            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THeſe Papers (which humbly offer themſelves to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage) were conceived and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but laid aſide ſome years before you did me that great honour to command my attendance on you and your Family, ſince which time by unuſual accident, they have fallen into a hand kinder than my own, who judging them worth the publiſhing, and perſwading me to it, they claim a Right to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:44263:3"/>of appearing in the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Lordſhip's Patronage; if I had refus'd to let them be made publick, perhaps I ſhould have been culpable; ſince they are thus publiſht, I am ſure (without omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a part of my duty) I could not but tender them to Your Lordſhip, which I do with a ſenſe of their meanneſs and diſproportion which they bear to your Lordſhips Great Abilities, Learning and Judgment. Yet herein this will be ſomewhat of an Apology for me, though ſome have owned their obligations and duty to Your Lordſhip in Pieces leſs diſproportion'd, none have done it, or are likely to do it in a Piece equal to Your Lordſhip's Learning and meaſures of Judgment. The ſmall ſumms of chief Rents are too poor to be made a Preſent to any whoſe abundance would refuſe ſuch an Offer; but when tender'd as their Right, they give a kind acceptance
<pb facs="tcp:44263:3"/>and acquittance for few ſhillings or pence. In this humble offer I wave all pretence but this, That Your Lordſhip hath the beſt Right to any Publick Acknowledgment I can make of my obligations to You, of which I pray Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's favourable reſentment</p>

                  <p>THOU art preſented here with a Subject of which very many have treated, and of which perhaps it may be thought more need not have been ſpoken; and of which, what I have written, muſt now run the hazard of thy judgment or cenſure; if it profit and pleaſe thee, the thanks is due to me, but in Partnerſhip, with a Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divine, who by an unthought of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident came to the knowledge of the two latter parts of what is here publiſht: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what alſo will be due to the Book-ſeller, who adventured the uncertainty of the Gain or Loſs, which will be more or leſs, as the Subject and Manner of handling it appears to the Peruſer. The good ſucceſs of thy Reading I commend to the Divine
<pb facs="tcp:44263:4"/>Benediction, which can make it contribute to the increaſe of thy Grace and Comfort: The Defects in Compoſing I ſubmit to thy Chriſtian Candour and Ingenuity which will cover them, and excuſe the Author. Thoſe miſtakes of the Printer which are moſt material, may be charged on him, and I with him will joyntly deſire they may be mended with a little labour beſtow'd on the places where the Errata's are marked. Finally, I pray no labour of mine in Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, no labour of thine in Reading, may prove waſte of time to either of us in the day wherein we both muſt account for our ſelves unto the Lord, to whoſe Guidance and Bleſsing thou ſhalt be commended</p>

                     <p>I will for once ſuppoſe thou art able on thy own view of theſe words, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to diſcern what Chriſt is treating of; how he inſtituteth and ordaineth the holy Sacrament of his Supper, and for what end he ordaineth it. I ſuppoſe thou wouldſt not look over theſe lines if thou didſt not alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy underſtand that Chriſt would have us uſe and celebrate this Sacrament to the end we might renew the remembrance of his Dying for us, in which the matter of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44263:6"/>he did die for us is profeſſed, yet ſo as the manner how he did die is (I think) more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be attended and conſidered, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief primary thing in effecting our ſalvation, and as affording the greateſt and ſweeteſt comforts; and finally, as binding us moſt ſtrongly to Goſpel Obedience.

And am bold to ſay the words of the text, <hi>(Do this in remembrance of me,)</hi> do the like. Let my Death be the ſubject of your thoughts at a Sacrament. Let the manner of my Death be the mould into which your thoughts are caſt. At a Sacrament ſhew forth the truth and certainty of your Redeemer's Death; ſhew forth the ſingular and peculiar manner of it alſo. Renew the thoughts of this, what kind of Death it was which could have ſuch a mighty ſalviſick vertue in it to deliver us and ſave us. Set before you at the the Lord's Table,

The Lord's Supper is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the Lord's Death; there we may view him on the Altar dying a Sacrifice for us, to atone the divine diſpleaſure: there we may view him in the unparalleld addreſs of himſelf for Death, diſpoſing his vaſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Grace, Peace, Comfort and Glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44263:6"/>his indigent friends for whom his love brought him to die, and the ſame love and care makes him die a Teſtator, giving them rich Legacies. At a Sacrament we may and ſhould view Jeſus Chriſt, the Bleſſed One, nailed to the Croſs, loaded with a Curſe, and dying an accurſed Death, that we might eſcape it. Thus we owe our Peace to his Sacrifice, our ſpiritual treaſure to his will and teſtament, our bleſſed hope and life to his accurſed Death; and by particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on theſe we ſhould awaken, exerciſe and improve our graces. The facilitating this work, and the attaining this effect, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the following Diſcourſe, which doth firſt endeavour to promote grace by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular improvement of Chriſt's Dying a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for us, let us then (the other two having their due place) begin with this great truth.</p>

Let us however look to ſome few places of Scriptures, where we may find Chriſt our Sacrifice in his Death typified out to us. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover is ſlain for us.</hi> The alluſion uſed by the Apoſtle proves that the old Paſchal Lamb was a type of Chriſt, and that Chriſt was the Antitype of the Paſchal Lamb. Again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.24. <hi>The Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world;</hi> whether in reference to the Lamb daily offered, or whether to the Paſchal Lamb, it altereth not the caſe: It is a Lamb, and a Lamb that muſt be ſlain in Sacrifice; yea in an Expiatory Sacrifice to take away the ſin of the world. We are aſſured,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> that <hi>without ſheding of blood there is no remiſſion;</hi> and we are ſure 'tis not every ſheding of blood, but it is the ſheding of the blood of a Sacrifice which procureth remiſſion of ſins, and this blood-ſheding was not by opening and breathing a vein, but by dying to take away ſin. The Baptiſt then applying unto Chriſt that antient and lively type, telleth us, that Chriſt was prefigured in his ſtate, life and death, by it. And that <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.23, 24. tells us of <hi>patterns of things in the Heavens,</hi> v. 23. and of <hi>figures of the True,</hi> v. 24. yea v. 8, 9. <hi>the</hi> whole <hi>Tabernacle, and the ſervice of it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44263:8"/>were a figure for the time then preſent.</hi> Among other ſervices, that of Sacrifices is ſpecified as a figure ſerving for the preſent, <hi>until Chriſt</hi> ſhould come and <hi>enter into the Holy Place</hi> without blood of Bulls and Goats, but <hi>by his own blood,</hi> v. 11, 12, 14. In a word, the whole of <hi>Moſaical</hi> poſitive inſtituted ſervice was a figure and type. This part of <hi>the Law had the ſhadow of good things to come,</hi> Heb. 10. v. 1.

                           <p>Thirdly, Chriſt to die for us a Sacrifice was promiſed to the Church; and if it were promiſed, it may well be concluded that it either ſhall be accompliſhed (which is as little as an unbelieving Jew will gather from the promiſe,) but not ſo much as a believing Chriſtian muſt gather, who is verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that our Jeſus, the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, and hath died for us, and died a Sacrifice fo us according to the promiſe which is made to <hi>Sion, Zech.</hi> 9.11. <hi>As for thee by the blood of thy Covenant I have ſent forth thy priſoners out of the Pit wherein is no water.</hi> In the words you have a relation of a double deliverance, ſet forth in figurative expreſſions.</p>

He needed no more to offer any Sacrifice, forſomuch as he had obtained Eternal Redemption by that one Sacrifice of himſelf; and it was neceſſary he ſhould once offer himſelf a Sacrifice, becauſe no other Sacrifices could purifie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and clear from guilt; Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did what was neceſſary, and having done it, ſate down on the right hand of God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting till his enemies were made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool, and interceding that his Redeemed might be bleſſed with a full deliverance. In one word, the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. tells us what Chriſt did, and what acceptance it found with the Father. Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Thus expreſs is the Scripture in this point.</p>

                           <p>Laſtly, It is more than once aſſumed and taken up as an unqueſtionable truth, and of indiſputable certainty. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.2. we have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44263:11"/>ſuch an High Prieſt who is ſet on the right hand of the Majeſty in the Heavens. Here it is aſſumed without particular proof, that he had offered a Sacrifice before he ſate down, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo <hi>ver.</hi> 3. makes it neceſſary he ſhould have ſomewhat to offer; and <hi>ver.</hi> 4. aſſures us, that the Levitical Prieſthood and Sacrifices, were examples and ſhadows of this our High Prieſt, and the Sacrifice he hath offered which was more excellent than thoſe typical ones were; to this add <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. Chriſt made an High Prieſt, and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. a Prieſt for ever, and after the order of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck, ver.</hi> 10. Now whoever is an High Prieſt, is ordained for men in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, that he may offer both gifts and ſacrifices for ſins, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. Chriſt then our High Prieſt as ſuch, and becauſe he is an High Prieſt for us, muſt offer ſome ſacrifice for us. Now the blood of Bulls and Goats, and in a word, all corruptible things, are ſecluded from being this ſacrifice; and the Lord Jeſus in his own perſon is ſuppoſed and taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to be this ſacrifice. Without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, the 9th <hi>chap.</hi> 25th <hi>verſe,</hi> ſpeaks this truth; for the Levitical High Prieſt went into the holy place with the blood of others, but Chriſt did not ſo enter when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, for he entred not in by the blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood, <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. did he enter into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. Theſe, with many more which might be added, comprize what we affirm, That the Scriptures do in many places aſſume it as a thing certain in it ſelf, that Chriſt died a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

                           <p>There is no doubt to be made whether ſacrificing of men were abominable in the ſight of God and ſober men; God infinitely

                           <p>He that was a murtherer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and delighteth in the death of man, put his Idolatrous worſhippers upon this diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal practice; and they who exerciſed their pretended Religion in ſuch ſacrifices, did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Devils, not to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37. and ſhed innocent blood, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.

The blood of Bulls or of Goats could not by their own worth pleaſe the Lord.

                           <p>I anſwer, that whoſo will compare Chriſt with others in this caſe, compareth thoſe who cannot be found juſt equals, there is a very great diſparity between our Lord Jeſus and any other who ſhall be compared with him, and therefore I doubt not to averr, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44263:14"/>there muſt be allowed as great diſparity in the thing debated, as there was diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the perſons; albeit none elſe might, yet he might do this extraordinary thing. There are four things wherein he excelled all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. As</p>
                           <p>Firſt, He was abſolute Lord of his own life, he had power to lay it down for his, if he ſo pleaſed, <hi>John</hi> 10.18. I have power to lay it [life] downe. This is more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary perſon can ſay of his owne life, which he is accountable for to many others, as to Governours, Relations, and ſuch as he may benefit, for whom he ſhould live. Chriſt therefore might manifeſt by an unuſual and Extraordinary diſpoſall of his life, how he was, more then ordinary men can be, Maſter of his life.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, He had power in his own hand to raiſe himſelf from the dead, which is more then the combined power of created Agents could do, for any man that ſhould yield himſelf a Sacrifice for others. He had power to take up his life again, <hi>John.</hi> 10.18. now this doth alter the caſe much, others may not becauſe they cannot reſcue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Death. He might, for having laid down his life and died for his, he might reſume his life and live as he doth to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable good and ſafety of his.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, He had ſpecial commiſſion from God to do this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. Now undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly where the authority of the Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth with the authority of the Son, there can be no reaſonable queſtion asked why Chriſt might become a ſacrifice for us, when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44263:14"/>we may not become ſacrifices for others. The caſe is infinitely different.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Fourthly and laſtly, Chriſt was Sacrificer as well as Sacrifice, and that no ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could ſay for himſelf; if any other be made a Sacrifice, the Sacrificer muſt be ſome other man who is under a ſtrict law of God, not to lay his hand on the life of his Brother; ſo that if a ſtrong impulſe moved me to be Sacrifice for other, yet as ſtrong Prohibition lay on him not to touch my life. But in this extraordinary Perſon both do concur, he is the Lamb of God ſlain, and he the great high Prieſt to offer it unto God.</p>
                           <p>Next I am engaged to enquire what is comprized in every ſuch Sacrifice, dying for him that offereth it, and ſo what particularly is comprized in Chriſt's dying a Sacrifice for us.

But the Ignorance of theſe ſalvage brutes may ſomewhat enervate the teſtimony I bring from them; be it ſo, yet hear one that cannot be excepted againſt in this point: when <hi>Abraham</hi> was commanded to ſacrifice his Son, he obeyed the command, and ſhewed at once how he underſtood God's command, and wherein his own obedience conſiſted when he put out his hand to ſlay his Son <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.10.</p>

In brief therefore, Chriſt a Sacrifice for us was ſubſtituted in our room, was charged with our guilt, recognized our faults, ſubmitted to their puniſhment, made our atonement, and recovered the Favour of God for us. This great atchievement is comprized in this ſmall and ſhort phraſe, <hi>Chriſt Died our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> Each of which particulars might eaſily be ſhewed in Chriſt's Sacrifice; but when we have ſhewed they are contained in all ſacrifices, it cannot be reaſonably doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether they are contained in the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Sacrifices.

                        <p>THE conſideration of Chriſt dying our Sacrifice, will afford us arguments well ſuited to excite our languiſhing graces, and to ſtrengthen our infirm graces, which ought to be more eſpecially found in us, and acted by us in our approaches to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as ſhall particularly be be ſhewed in theſe that follow.</p>

                           <p>Repentance is unqueſtionably a Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Grace. None is fit to commemorate the Death of Chriſt, who repenteth not of the ſin which occaſioned his Dying. The weeping eye, and mourning heart, are exceeding lovely to the Lord at his Table. A Repenting ſoul is a welcome gueſt there. Now let me trace Repentance through theſe paths. and ſee as we go how it may be ſuitably fitted with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveing arguments from Chriſt our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Repentance beginneth ordinarily in a conviction of ſin, not in general only, but par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the convictions of our owne ſin. The righteous need no repentance,
<note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> it is the Sinner which is called to repent; ſo long as a proud Phariſaical opinion of our own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is maintained by us, we ſhall never embrace the practice of Repentance.</p>
                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44263:18"/>
                           <p n="2">2. Apprehenſion of danger either attends or flows from this conviction of the ſinner, and this forwardeth his repentance; the ſhameful, curſed death ſin deſerveth, and the ſinner fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the midſt of his ſorrows, hath ſtrong influence upon the ſoul to grieve for ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undoing ſin. Although a ſecure unconvinced ſinner bleſſeth himſelf, and feareth no danger, the awakened convinced Penitent apprehends greateſt danger from his ſin.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Conſternation of mind, or Amazement at the ſight of ſin and danger unavoidable, for ought the man can do of himſelf for his own help, this I might call [if none will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it] a ſeaſonable and profitable deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of our ſelves, while we conſider our ſelves and obſerve what we have done, what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what God hath threatned, and what millions do, and muſt for ever ſuffer for ſin.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. A mixture of Hope that there may be, and of Deſires that there ſhould be, and of enquiry whether there be not ſome effectutal help &amp; remedy to be obtained. The awakned ſoul doth as it were look about to ſee what or whence it's help may come. Enquireth what ſhall I do to be ſaved? How ſhall I eſcape? &amp;c. Now when it deſcryeth mercy to be had upon it's Humbling of it ſelf before God, upon condition of ſorrow for what is paſt, and of hatred of ſin for time to come, the Penitent ſoul ſet's it ſelf to exert all theſe, and in a vigorous, conſtant, uniform exerting theſe, conſiſteth the whole life and Practice of Repentance: And I hope I ſhall cleare it. Chriſt conſidered Dying, our Sacrifice will be an awakening conſideration preparatory to,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44263:19"/>and promoting of this Repentance in its farther Exerciſe and Growth.</p>

                           <p>Chriſt Dying a Sacrifice well conſidered, will conduce much to the Convincing us of a ſtate of ſin, and that we were in particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in it, we were ſinners, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Law of God imputed the ſin to us, and the righteous Judge [whoſe it was to execute the Law] accounted thee and me, and every one of the children of <hi>Adam</hi> [as we are] tranſgreſſours of the Law; if thou ſeeſt not this, look to the Lord Chriſt a Sacrifice for ſin, and ruminate what anſwer thou canſt make to theſe few Queſtions.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. What need had there been of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for ſin, if there had been no ſin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate by Sacrifice? There is certainly ſin committed where 'tis neceſſary to take away wrath by a Sacrifice. There is ſin of the ſoul, whereſoever an offering for ſin is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Tell me then, ſeeing Chriſt was made an offering for ſin, what was thy ſtate and mine? and what was the ſtate of all men for whom he became a Sacrifice?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Couldeſt thou eſcape the imputation of ſin, when Chriſt a Sacrifice for ſin could not eſcape it? Could he not be a ſacrifice for ſin by a voluntary ſuſception of our cauſe, but he muſt bear our guilt? and ſhall we judge it likely, reaſonable, or indeed morally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that our wilful tranſgreſſings of the Law ſhould be paſſed over, not imputed? If thy ſins were imputed to thy ſacrifice, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44263:19"/>they had been imputed unto thy ſelf, if thou hadſt not had a ſacrifice. Stand then a while, and view this: No need of Sacrifice to expiate where no ſin is; but alas I needed ſuch a Sacrifice: No need of Sacrifice where no guilt is imputed; but I ſee my ſin, I ſee 'tis imputed, I muſt not delay or trifle in this matter; my ſin is evident, its imputation is certain; it will be laid on my own head, or on my Sacrifice, and oh how impoſſible is it I ſhould eſcape the imputation of it, if I care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neglect this great Sacrifice! For,</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Whoſe is the guilt? is it his? or is it mine? who deepeſt in the guilt? he who did no guile, or I who am full of guile? who neareſt the crime? he who never did it, or I who very wickedly committed it? Did God impute it to him, and can an unhumbled ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner think God will not impute it unto the committer of the ſin?</p>
                           <p n="4">4. With whom was God angry? who was it againſt whom offended juſtice was moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed? was it againſt him that was the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, or againſt him that needed the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and brought it? undoubtedly the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice can bear no other diſpleaſure than what it bears for him whoſe Sacrifice it is, and for whom it is offered. And canſt thou hope guilty offenders may eſcape, when guiltleſs victims are charged with another's guilt, and ſuffer another's puniſhment?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Who hath greater ſhare in the Love of God? had Chriſt, thy Sacrifice for ſin, or hadſt thou, for whom he became a Sacrifice? I know thou wilt not pretend a compariſon with Chriſt the only begotten of the Father;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44263:20"/>thou dareſt not think but his ſhare was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Fathers love, as his love, obedience and likeneſs to his Father was greater, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more excellent than thine was, or could be. Tell me then, if God imputed ſin to the Son of his Love, when his Son had undertaken to bear the fault and puniſhment of offenders, will he, thinkeſt thou, ſpare thoſe who hate him, and might juſtly be hated of him?</p>
                           <p n="6">6. Would God admit his Son, his eternal Delight, to be thy Saviour on no other terms than that he ſhould as a Sacrifice take upon him, and bear the ſins of his people imputed to him, that they might not be imputed unto them; and doſt thou not believe, canſt thou perſwade thy ſelf to imagine that thou mayeſt, though a ſinner, yet not be charged with thy ſin? Doſt thou not clearly diſcern that God will charge ſin either on the ſinner, or on his Sacrifice?</p>
                           <p>In a word or two, whoever knows that Chriſt was made a Sacrifice for ſin, knows alſo that they were under a ſtate of ſin, for whom he was made a Sacrifice; and if thou art a Chriſtian, and profeſſeſt that Chriſt was thy Sacrifice, thou doſt thereby confeſs that thou wert under a ſtate of ſin; that unleſs mercy toward thee impute thy ſin to Chriſt, juſtice will impute it unto thy own ſelf. View theſe theſe things, and weigh them impartially, poſſibly they may prevail to the convincing of the heart of its ſinful ſtate, and of the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a future imputation of ſin, unleſs it be prevented by repentance. And leſt thou ſhouldſt flatter thy ſelf that there is little or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44263:20"/>no danger in appearing before God under im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſin, I adviſe thee to conſider</p>

                           <p>The greatneſs of thy danger, as it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in thy Sacrifice. See if thou mayeſt not deſcry</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Death as certainly following thy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as imputation of ſin did follow the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a Sacrifice. He muſt die who took thy ſin upon him; he cannot eſcape who is thy Sacrifice. If Chriſt taking thy ſin on him, could not have the Cup paſs from him, thinkeſt thou there can be any thing but death awaiting thee under thy ſin? is not here danger? is not here great danger? I know not what may be accounted danger, if death be not; I know not what is greateſt danger if death under imputed ſin be not.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Was not the Death of Chriſt thy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice full of ſorrows and grief; he was <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, Iſa.</hi> 53.3. and if his life were ſpent in ſorrows, I am ſure his death was full of them. Look on him his in agony in the garden; explain me the meaning of thoſe unparalleld drops of blood; tell me the ſtory of his enemies cruelly buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting, ſpitting, crowning him with thorns, and forcing thoſe into his tender temples, his bleſſed head: Theſe were preparatory griefs; was ever grief like this? this thy ſin deſerved; this thou muſt if Chriſt had not ſuffered; thou muſt have been the ſcorn and triumph of Devils, who forever would tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wrack thee. What then judgeſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44263:21"/>thou of death thus aggravated? what thinkeſt thou of the grief and pain of his ſoul when hands and feet were nailed to the Croſs? when he hanged there under the ſharp pains of a lingriug death? what grief was that breath'd out it ſelf in that, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> I ſpeak not of the acuteneſs of his pains, which the School-men ſpeak of. Let me obtain thy ſober thoughts of the ſorrows of our Dying Saviour and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and then ſay whether there is danger, and how great the danger of thy ſin is? then ſay, canſt thou think of thy danger without fear and aſtoniſhment? what will become of ſinners under the burthen of ſorrows which their ſins deſerve, and God will heap upon them?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. View the perſon who thus ſuffered, view him, I ſay, in all his Interreſſe in the Father's love, in all the Priviledges of his nature, perſon and office, in all the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and excellency of his obedience; and ſee whether any one, or all theſe could exempt him from, or defend him againſt that flame thy ſins had kindled, and which his blood alone muſt quench, or it will burn for ever; and when thou haſt thought of this, then tell me thy danger.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Was not his power and ſtrength, the power and the ſtrength of a God, united to the Humane Nature, to ſupport it, and yet for all this his Fears, Dangers, Sorrows, were enough to try all his power; and albeit he conquered, yet not without a bitter conflict. How then couldeſt thou have eſcaped or born theſe dangers? Thus make an unconvinced
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44263:21"/>heart look on ſin in it's Sacrifice, make a ſelf flattering, ſecure, fearleſs heart look on the certainty, and greatneſs of it's own danger in the ſorrows and grief which fell upon Chriſt our Sacrifice; when thou haſt proceeded thus far in this Matter, bring thy ſelf to determine theſe two things, (1.) whether thou canſt bear all the miſery which ſin deſerved, and all the ſorrows this Sacrifice did ſuſtain? Canſt thou bear the diſpleaſure of the Almighty? if thou think'ſt thou canſt, I pity, and mourn for thee; if thou thinkeſt thou canſt not, then (2.) ſay, canſt thou find out a way for thine eſcape? if the infinit wiſe God hath not found out any expedient beſide this; doſt thou think thou canſt find it out? well then, if it be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and thou canſt not bear it, if unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and thou canſt not fly from it; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth but being ſhut up under ſin [as the Scripture ſpeaketh] thou ſhouldſt alſo be ſhut up in Priſon, reſerved for the day of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any hope in thy ſelf, for thou readeſt thy guilt in the Imputation of ſin to thy ſacrifice, thou readeſt thy death and danger in the death of thy ſacrifice, thou rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt deſpair in the unſupportableneſs of the miſery, and in the unavoidableneſs of it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; thou art undone, and miſerable in thy ſelf, which cannot but end in conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind, and amazement, and likely may break out into ſuch enquiries, who can dwell with devouring Fire, with everlaſting Burnings? who ſhall deliver us from wrath to come? how ſhall I eſcape ſuch great miſery? what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Is there not yet Balm in <hi>Gilead?</hi> is there not a Phyſician

                           <p n="4">4. Although the death of thy Sacrifice did preach thy danger, and thy helpleſs ſtate in thy ſelf, yet doth it alſo preach help for thee in another; it proclaimeth hope of eſcape; for here is a Sacrifice for ſin, and where a Sacrifice is admitted, the offence may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be remitted, and the offender may be reconciled. They that ſought out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed their own ſacrifices for their Gods, maintained their falſe hopes by this mean. And the carnal Jew miſtaking the nature of his ſacrifices, kept up his preſumptuous hopes by the ſame means, concluding his peace was made, becauſe the ſacrifice is offered: But he among the Jews who underſtood the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Nature, End and Uſe of the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifices, did obtain at firſt, and did maintain unto the laſt a ſound peace between his God and his ſoul. Where there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſacrifice, there is an open and plain declaration of our apprehenſions, that 1. Our ſins are expiable. 2. That ſacrifice is the way of expiation. And 3. That this ſacrifice is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by us, fit to expiate our offence. Theſe are the common, if not univerſal ſuppoſitions of all ſacrificing offenders.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44263:22"/>Albeit he checked the formal Jew, and rejected the Idolatrous Heathen and their ſacrifices witha <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> yet he never will diſcourage any one who tenders to him by a hand of faith this Propitiatory Sacrifice: He will admit this, if thou canſt preſent it to him by faith. Lift up therefore the feeble hands, the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing head, the fainting heart; there is hope, nay aſſurance that ſins may be expiated. For</p>
                           <p n="2">2. This Sacrifice is of God's own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he provided it; when we were at a loſs, and could not find wherewith we ſhould come before the Lord, and bow our ſelves before the moſt High God; when the fruit of our body could not expiate the ſin of our ſoul; when finite wiſdom was non-plus'd, then the Lord diſcover'd his Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and choſe out a ſacrifice for us; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared this ſacrifice: We may (as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) varying the tenſe ſay, <hi>God hath provided himſelf a Sacrifice.</hi> This he ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out to us by preſcribing all his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. This he telleth us when he ſaith, He prepared a body for Chriſt, when he ſaith, He ſent him, and gave him to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us, and ſealed him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch like expreſſions. He, the Lamb of God, becauſe ordained of God, was our Sacrifice. Theſe two things conſidered, let the guilty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, fearing and almoſt deſponding ſoul, debate the caſe againſt his own fears and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts. Put ſuch Queſtions to an iſſue.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Shall I deſpair when I have a ground to hope? Let him embrace his deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies who cannot ſee a ground for hope; my
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44263:23"/>heart breaks not while my hope is whole and unbroken.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Are not thoſe hopes well bottom'd which are built on the aſſurance that ſins (my only dangers and fears) are pardonable? <hi>Cain</hi> perhaps would have hoped if he had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended his ſin pardonable. And I am bound to hope, becauſe God aſſureth me by this ſacrifice, that my ſins are expiable, and may be pardoned.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Why is there an Expiatory Sacrifice admitted, nay provided by God himſelf, who is the ſupreme <hi>vindex culpae,</hi> and who alone had <hi>jus poenae,</hi> the power of executing puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the offenders? Hath he appointed a Sacrifice to expiate my ſin, and can it be that my ſin remaineth inexpiable, unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? Is not that ſacrifice ſufficient which God himſelf ſindeth out? Away with unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable fears! baniſh forever ſinful diſtruſt! Here's a Sacrifice to atone my offended Lord, of his own providing, and will he not accept it? I will tender it, I will mention it; he will not refuſe his own choice.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Can any one be found who miſſed the benefit of a pardon, that ſought it in the blood of this Sacrifice? Oh that I could believe and hope until I heard of one ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed! then ſhould I never be aſhamed. Hath he not put away ſin by once offering of himſelf? and hath he not by one ſacrifice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perfected thoſe that believe, that are ſanctified?</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Am I not one who may betake my ſelf to this ſacrifice? What ſhould more hinder me than others? Am I excepted out of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44263:23"/>Act of Oblivion? Why may not my ſins be laid on this Sacrifice? Do I not read that he liveth for ever to make interceſſion for thoſe that come to God by him? Oh glorious hope! Interceſſion for all that come to God by him! Then cheer up doubting heart, here is a ſacrifice for all that come to God by him; for this Interceſſion is an act or exerciſe of Chriſt's Sacerdotal Office ſubſequent to, and dependent upon his foregoing Sacrifice. He ſacrificeth for as many as he intercedeth; if then the Interceſſion of Chriſt can impetrate and obtain favour, it is becauſe the Sacrifice of Chriſt hath expiated thy ſin and crime.</p>

                        <div n="5" type="section">

                           <p n="5">5. Thus far Guilt, Danger, and Feares may by eyeing the Sacrifice, convince the ſinner how ſeaſonable a good hope would be, and this Sacrifice ſheweth how good the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's hope is. Now would it well become the ſoul to humble it ſelf, and if thou find thy heart remain ſtill proud and unhumbled, ask it theſe Queſtions over thy Sacrifice.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Canſt thou be proud, and yet be found worthy to die in thy Sacrifice? can this be born? wilt thou confeſs death is thy deſert, and yet bear up as if thou wert innocent, and in no deſerved danger?</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Canſt thou be proud of any thing ſo long as thy life is the fruit of an Expiatory Sacrifice? Thou liveſt by the death of another, and wilt thou pride thy ſelf as if thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt not any ones help?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Canſt thou confeſs guilt, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44263:24"/>a thought of worth in thy ſelf? How ſhameleſs is that pride which at the bar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it's Guilt againſt the Law, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it ſelf againſt the Law-giver! It is a moſt unſeemly thing to behold a heart riſing with pride, and falling in a Sacrifice. Let thy humility then ſute thy ſtate as it appeareth in thy Sacrifice, and I dare ſay it will ſute the ſtate of thy ſoul in it's repentance, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſin.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p n="6">6. Fountains and Springs lye deep, &amp; where the ſoul is laid thus low, if it doth not freely and ſpontaneouſly weep, bring it's Sacrifice into ſight, let that be viewed; ſee it ſtanding before an offended and diſpleaſed God, who was provoked by thy ſin, look on it loaded with imputed guilt. Alas my ſin lyeth upon it; obſerve thy Sacrifice falling before the Altar, and ſay, alas! was not this for my ſake? ſhould not I have fallen thus if he had not? He bled, and out of exceſs of love to me, poured out his life for me; he groaned, ſighed, breath'd out his ſoul for my ſake, and could he do more? alas! have I brought my Sacrifice to this? was ever man more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to his friend, to his Brother? how hard are thoſe ſtony Rocks? how dry that flinty heart which guſheth not out with tears in Remembrance of theſe things? My deareſt Lord pity unrelenting ſoules, and oh! give a mourning heart that may be more equal in it's griefes, and ſorowes, in it's teares and ſympathies! how many eyes weep at newes of an endangered, troubled, impriſoned and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44263:24"/>wrackt friend! How many hearts are ſoftned, melted, and broken with the ſweats, burning — fits and Agonies of a dying man? yea how many melting hearts, and weeping eyes? how many compaſſionate diſcourſes on the death of ſome one deſerving more than Law inflicts for his breach of the Law? But how few over a ſuffering, bleeding, dying Saviour and Sacrifice? whither are the compaſſions of men and women fled? where may they be found? where ſhall we ſeek? or how ſhall we wooe and prevail with them? Lo! their friend and Lord charged with their guilt, ſweating under its weight, groaning under its penalty, ſighing with ſobs that drew blood out of his veins, bleeding, dying a Sacrifice, loaded with our deſerved puniſhment. And few alas! very few grieving hearts, weeping eyes, or mourners for their want of tears Lord! give more, that I may give ſome tears, to waſh thy bleeding wounds.</p>

                           <p>The Death of Chriſt under the notion of the Death of a Sacrifice, will improve the Believer's Faith; which I hope will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted when we have viewed the grand concern of Faith in theſe three particulars.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44263:25"/>1. It's Expectation, or the things it waiteth for. 2. The grounds of its Expectation and waiting. 3. The preſent actings of Faith, whilſt it is aſſured there are ſuch things to be expected, and whilſt it is perſwaded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to wait for them. Of all which in order.</p>

                              <p n="1">1. Faith hath its expectation, and looketh for things that are not ſeen. <hi>Things hoped for,</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. And theſe are great things. As,</p>

                              <p n="3">3.

                              <p n="4">4. The Faith of a Believer looketh after a reward for all its obedience, whether active, conforming to the Precepts and Rule of Chriſt, or paſſive, bearing the Croſs of Chriſt. It is one of the excellencies of the Law of Faith, that as it commands no more than it enableth us to do; ſo it rewardeth no leſs than we have done. The diſtribution grace doth make, is firſt ſo much as we need to work, and next, ſo much as we have wrought, the Believer receiveth according to his works, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.35, 36. And when grace hath thus diſtributed to each, then ſhall we find our labour was not in vain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 58.

Faith expects that the light and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany aſſlictions ſhould work for him a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. We expect a glory to be revealed, with which theſe light afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this life are not worthy to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. Such are the expectations of Faith, and may well be confirmed as ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and juſtifiable, by the conſideration of their being built upon the Death of Chriſt our Sacrifice. For</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Doth a Believer expect abſolution? why ſhould he not? Chriſt his Sacrifice hath born his guilt and puniſhment. Or Secondly</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Doth a Believer expect a declaration of his adoption to be a Child of God? this is no more than the promiſe of the Covenant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in this Sacrifice, God will be his Father.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. Doth the Believer expect an inveſtiture into a Throne, Kingdom and Crown? why all theſe are by Chriſt our Sacrifice procured for us, after they were forfeited by us.</p>
                              <p n="4">4. Doth the Believer expect a reward for all his obedience both active and paſſive? well. He may; For all his obedience is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in it's worth by this blood ſprinkled on it. This Sacrifice hath merited it, albeit our obedience could not; this, [in the Apoſtle's words] one Sacrifice hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. Faith exceeds not its bounds when it expects con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumate, and full Perfection of happiueſs. Theſe are the Grand expectations of faith, let us view how juſtifiably faith may expect all
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44263:26"/>theſe ſince that the foundation and ground of faith's expectation is ſecured and made good by the Death of Chriſt our Sacrifice.</p>

                              <p n="2">2. The Foundation or ground of Faith's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is the promiſe and covenant of God; upon this Faith builds it's hopes: before God promiſeth we may repoſe ſome kind of truſt that he will do good for us, but we cannot firmely and properly believe: the Mariners <hi>Jonah.</hi> 1.6. had ſome hope and truſt that God would ſhew them mercy, but this amounted not properly to a degree worthy the name of faith, it reſted ſtill upon the Divine Goodneſs; poſſibly God will think on us, but it had no promiſe on which it might conclude, God will think on us for good. But now when once God hath promiſed, and given out the word of Grace and Mercy, the ſoul findeth a fit ground to build it's faith upon, thus God ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and gave him the promiſe, <hi>ſo ſhall thy ſeed be, Gen.</hi> 15.5.

Now what is there which a believing ſoul may not rationally expect from the love of his reconciled God?

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44263:28"/>by Chriſt's Sacrifice? which of them is not confirmed by the Oath of the Almighty? if the Friendſhip of God can afford them, if the Covenant hath promiſed them, if the oath of an immutable God hath enſured them, if a moſt immaculate Sacrifice hath procured them, what can intercept them? what can ſhake ſuch a foundation of Faith? haſt thou not all aſſurance given that reaſon or religion can deviſe? and tell me (1.) would you not truſt a man under hand and ſeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming articles of agreement, and ratifying them by oath? wouldſt thou not ſay, I have him faſt enough?

(3.) Wilt thou not much more truſt and believe thy God who hath condeſcended to bind himſelf unto thee by all that is inviolable? by all the bonds that men account ſacred? Hath he not removed whatever difficulties lay in the way to hinder his entring into Covenant with us; and difficulties being once removed, hath he not power enough to keep them ſtill from returning and interpoſing? Our ſins lay a bar on our part, making us unfit to enter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Theſe are done away by this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The Juſtice of God, honour of his Law and Government, might be obſtacles on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44263:29"/>God's part.

He will never think any mercy too good to give, which he did not think too great to promiſe. This is the foundation of Faith, and thus ſurely and immovably laid for us to build on; which is the ſecond part of the grand concern of Faith.</p>

Indeed it ſeeth what is far off,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44263:29"/>yet brings that which it ſeeth ſo near, that it embraceth what it ſeeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14. Faith is of very great and preſent advantage to the ſoul, and exerts its power and vertue on the ſoul; in theſe four particulars.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Faith doth by the improvement of the Promiſes ratified in the blood of Chriſt our Sacrifice, quiet and ſettle the ſoul in ſome good meaſure of peace and aſſurance. This is one of the ſweet and firſt-fruits of Faith, that it quieteth the heart, and pacifieth it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as unbelief doth fill the heart with fears. And a convinced ſoul under doubts, is as reſtleſs as fears can make it; for it is full of them. Where there is little Faith, there are uſually on every awakening alarm (as in <hi>Peter</hi>'s caſe) great fears. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled</hi> [ſaith Chriſt] caſt out diſquieting thoughts; for, ſaith he, <hi>Ye believe in God, Joh.</hi> 14.1. And indeed the Believer may well be quiet, for he believeth on Chriſt, of whom the God of Truth hath ſaid, That <hi>whoſo believeth on him ſhall not be confounded,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. Now this greatly pacifieth the ſoul; it knows it ſhall not be confounded; it hath received the earneſt of a glorious inheritance, and is ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe upon its believing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. Amidſt the many and great troubles the Apoſtle met with for the Goſpel, his Faith kept his heart in a very quiet and pacate frame. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whom I have truſted,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. He ſpeaketh of himſelf as of one whom no troubles could much diſquiet; for he did both know that he believed, and he knew whom he believed. Hence it is that when
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44263:30"/>he prayed for Peace and Joy to fill the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Romans, cap.</hi> 15.13. He makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs mention of their Faith as the means of their Peace;
<note place="margin">
                                    <hi>Pax acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur fide.</hi> Vatablus in loc.</note> 
                                 <hi>Now the God of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing,</hi> &amp;c. Peace and ſedateneſs of mind is one of the firſt-born of Faith; as on the contrary, diſquietude of mind is the firſt-born of deſpondency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. So <hi>David</hi>'s experience aſſureth us, who found his quiet of mind decreaſe, and the diſquiet thereof to increaſe, as his truſt in God did decreaſe; therefore he rowſeth up himſelf to truſt in God, that he might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the calm of his ſpirit: <hi>Why art thou caſt down, oh my ſoul! and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God, Pſal.</hi> 42.11. This then is one of the preſent great buſineſſes of Faith, to quiet the heart, and bring it into a peaceable ſtate.</p>
                              <p>Now what can give the heart reſt, if ſuch glorious things expected and ſecured to us do not? The Believer may ſee all his hopes moſt inviolably, and under the moſt ſacred ſeals, confirmed to him in the Death of Chriſt by Sacrifice; and certainly if greatneſs of hopes, accompanied with immutable aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a future enjoying them, do not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and quiet for preſent, nothing ever will be able in this world to compoſe the ſpirit of any man. How quietly doth an expectant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Court wait for his preferment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance upon the promiſe of his Friend and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron who poſſibly may fail! How well will it become us to wait quietly for our great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement on the Promiſe, Covenant, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44263:30"/>Oath of our God, in which it is impoſſible he ſhould fail us?</p>
                              <p n="2">2. Faith doth at preſent revive and refreſh the ſoul; it adminiſtreth cordials to it: <hi>I had fainted if I had not believed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.13. And he preſcribeth waiting or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving as an excellent preſervative againſt ſuch faintneſs and deſpondence of ſpirit, <hi>v.</hi> 14. on which he reſolveth, <hi>at what time he is afraid he will truſt in God, Pſal.</hi> 56.3. No ſupport, no reviving comparable to that Faith doth aford. That Peace and that Joy which the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. hath annexed unto Faith, is a Peace with God, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in hope of the glory of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That God will make us glorious in that glory which he hath prepared for all that believe. Now they that expect on unfailing promiſes ſuch Glory, may juſtifiably ſay, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is renewed [not in ſtrength only, but in comfort alſo] day by day, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. We faint not, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. though our outward man periſh; why, what kept up their ſpirit? did any thing but Faith? The Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth nothing elſe; <hi>For our inward man is renewed day by day, while we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen, v.</hi> 18. While we look, <hi>i. e.</hi> with an eye of Faith.

And the <hi>Syriack,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it uſe a native or a forein word in its tranſlation, doth uſe a word which implieth an eminent act of Faith. When the heavy burthen of guilt overloadeth the heart; when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44263:31"/>the violence, ſtrangeneſs and frequency of temptations ſadneth the ſoul; when fierce, long and waſting perſecutions make havock of the Church; when ſpiritual dulneſs and deadneſs of ſoul afflicteth a Believer, what but his Faith can or doth comfort and revive him? Faith carrieth him to his Sacrifice in the blood whereof he ſeeth his God atoned and reconciled, who then ſhall condemn? A Covenant of grace and mercy, what grace then can he want? In this Sacrifice he ſeeth, Chriſt hath perfected all that are ſanctified and done, all that which Legal Sacrifices ſhadowed out, but could not work out, <hi>viz.</hi> Perfect Reconciliation to God, and full paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Conſcience. This revives the heart; God ſpeaks peace, and Conſcience ſpeaks peace, and Faith doth at preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it ſelf in enſuring and improving both theſe for the comfort of the Believer. And this part of the life of Faith is ſo evidently maintained upon the Death of Chriſt, as our Sacrifice making our peace with God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the promiſes of grace and glory, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring to us the grand expectations of this and the other world, that I think it needleſs to inſiſt farther on this particular Chriſt dying our Sacrifice is the great reviving comfort of an awakened, convinced, fainting, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. The third thing in the preſent Actings of Faith, while it on good and ſure grounds waiteth for the great things which are to be revealed, is the active diligence of Faith to do the whole work which is appointed for it to do. Faith giveth not a diſcharge from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44263:31"/>any one degree of our required induſtry in good, nor doth it releaſe to us any one of the Moral Precepts of the Law; no, Faith maketh not the Law void, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. The Apoſtle aſſureth us that the Faith of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver engageth him to walk and to labour, ſo as to be accepted with God; ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 57. &amp;9. <hi>We walk by Faith not by ſight</hi> [ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>] <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Wherefore we labour that whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or abſent we may be accepted of him. ver</hi> 9. It is but the counterfeit of Faith which lieth unactive and regardleſs to do the will of God; when once the ſoul can judg [which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in it both an act of diſcerning, and an act of beliveing or aſſenting to the truth] That one [<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt] died for all, it doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude that henceforth they who live, ſhould not live to themſelves but to him that died for them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. It is the rational concluſion Faith draweth from the Grace of God toward us in Chriſt dying for us, that our life which we have of mercy, muſt be laid out in duty; and the reward we expect ſhould animate us to the ſervice God expecteth. Mark the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter's</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of arguing, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. Since, ſaith he, <hi>We look and haſten to the comming of the day of God;</hi> and again, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>We according to his promiſe, look for new Heavens;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>ſeeing Beloved that ye look for ſuch things.</hi> For as much as we are verily perſvaded of the truth of theſe future things, and for as much as we do by Faith expect an aſſured fulfilling of them; <hi>Be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without ſpot and blameleſs;</hi> ſo the Apoſtle intimateth to us, nay preſſeth it upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44263:32"/>us as the proper buſineſs of Faith as it's whole imploy to be pure, and without blame, and to be diligent herein. Now what can be thought will excite and animate a believer unto this, if the great things purchaſed and enſured to him by the Death of Chriſt his Sacrifice do not? The Apoſtle well knew the weight of the argument, your labour you know, ſhall not be in vain in the Lord; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee that ye abound in the work of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. When thou art back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or ſluggiſh, take thy heart, and diſcover to it what a Kingdom, what a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thy Lord hath ſecured to thee, and ask if it be not worth thy greateſt diligence, and thy moſt active induſtry?</p>
                              <p n="4">4. The fourth concern of Faith in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deportment, and the influence it now hath on the heart, is to ſtrengthen and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it under all kind of ſufferings and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, be they common to us as men, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to us as Chriſtians. Our Faith is our life in the midſt of theſe deaths. Hence we find Faith joined with patience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had received the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which God made to him when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved God would do all that for him which God had promiſed to him he did patiently endure, and ſo obtained, <hi>v.</hi> 15. The Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth his many and great ſufferings which with others he ſuffered for Chriſt. Troubled on every ſide, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8. Perplexed <hi>ver.</hi> 8. Perſecuted, caſt down, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Always bearing about in the body, the dying of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. Alway delivered unto Death; for Jeſus ſake, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Theſe were their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44263:32"/>and troubles; now ſee their ſupport, which was a ſpirit of Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14, &amp;c. Read over the 11th chapter of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſee what afflictions thoſe faithful ones did through Faith undergo; and it will be paſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with you, that for the preſent Faith doth mightily ſuſtain the ſpirit under the variety and ſharpneſs of afflictions and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which it doth among other helps princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, by looking to the greatneſs of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reward and glory, ſecured unto it by the moſt immutable Covenant and Oath of God, ratified in the blood of Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. So the Apoſtle directeth us to look to Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3. <hi>enduring the Croſs, and deſpiſing the ſhame;</hi> to Jeſus who endured contradictions of ſinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. This will be a means to prevent the fainting of our minds under our troubles and ſufferings. The reconciliation between God and us, his Promiſe to us, his Covenant with us, his Oath and Chriſt's Sacrifice all aſſure us he is faithful who hath promiſed us our pardon and abſolution from guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, our adoption and right of children to a glorious Inheritance; our ſolemn and publick inveſtiture and admiſſion into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Crown and Kingdom. He is faithful who hath by means of moſt ſacred obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, aſſured us a reward for every duty, active and paſſive; therefore <hi>let us hold faſt our Profeſſion without wavering, Heb.</hi> 10.23. And who will not hold his Profeſſion faſt, when he is aſſured that the Sacrifice Chriſt hath offered, hath reconciled us to God; ſo that our ſufferings are not expreſſes of his vengeance, but neceſſary exerciſes of our
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44263:33"/>graces, and proofs of the Love of God to us? who would be weary of bearing, who is perſwaded that his ſufferings are but light and momentany; and that they do infallibly work out a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory? How do things infinitely leſs valuable, and extremely uncertain, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men to undergo hardſhips; to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture through fire and water, to bear watchings, toil, nakedneſs, hunger and thirſt? How patiently doth the Husbandman, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Souldier and Courtier, ſubmit to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hazards at utmoſt uncertainties to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their hopes, which often do make them aſhamed? But now, who looketh to the eſtabliſhing of the Promiſe, and to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the things promiſed, and vieweth them in the Death of Chriſt as a Sacrifice, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth greateſt joys, rewards and glory on the ſureſt ground, and moſt infallible certainty; and therefore reſolveth neither to yield to fainting, or to ſit down under wearineſs; he will look to Jeſus the Mediatour of the New Covenant, and ſee what he may expect after ſufferings, and will ſuffer that he may enjoy what he doth expect.</p>
                              <p>Thus Faith may be confirmed and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as to each part wherein it is concerned, by duly conſidering Chriſt's dying our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, enſureth on moſt invioſable bonds, the moſt deſirable good things for future, and doth for preſent ſufficiently influence our Faith to quiet, revive, quicken and ſupport the ſoul under fears, languiſhings, dulneſſes and ſufferings. Go then aſide, and take a view of the particulars, and meditate on them in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44263:33"/>the certainty which Chriſt ſuffering and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sacrifice, hath given to us concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and when thou haſt ſo done, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve well whether thou art not perſwaded to believe in hope againſt hope; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art not enabled to believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes without ſtaggering, and to ſay, thou fainteſt not, becauſe thy afflictions are light, and yet do work out for thee a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and eternal weight of glory, while thou art able to look to, and ſee both him that is, and the things that are inviſible? ſuch a Faith will be our victory, by it we ſhall more than conquer. Having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed ſomewhat on the Improvement of our Divine ſorrow, and our Faith in the Commemoration of Chriſt Dying our Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I have made way for the Improvement of our Peace and Quiet of ſoul likewiſe;
<note place="margin">3d. Grace improved, <hi>viz.</hi> Peace of Soul.</note> for this is a ſweet fruit of our ſound Repentance and ſincere faith, and carry's a proportioned dimenſion with the increaſe of thoſe Graces. But I purpoſe to attempt a more particular diſcovery of the influence Chriſt's Death our Sacrifice hath upon the Tranquillity and Peace of the ſoul of a Communicant, who diſcerneth this Death as it was a Sacrifice, and under that notion improveth his Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's love to him. Now if I can ſhew my Reader that there is in this Sacrifice ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſufficient to remove all that diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſoul, I need take no further care to perſwade an opinion that Peace will follow, Let the ſtorm ceaſe, and a calm will follow; if the Earthquake end, the old Foundations will ſtand firm, and well ſetled, Let that be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44263:34"/>removed, which alarmed the ſoul, and all will be in Peace. Amongſt other (leſſer which I paſs over) there are four grand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes of the ſoul.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Danger of divine diſpleaſure and wrath in condemnation for our ſin. The drawn ſword of Divine vengeance hanging over the head, is enough to affright all peace out of the heart, and to fill it with amazing hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and overwhelming terrours. How did <hi>Adam</hi>'s fears ſeize him, when his ſin had laid him open to that threat, <hi>Thou ſhalt die the death? Gen.</hi> 2.17. then his guilty conſcience did chaſe,

                              <p n="2">2. Loſs of the wonted ſweetneſs of Divine favour, and the refreſhing expreſſes which God by his ſpirit did formerly give to the ſoul. When once the ſoul hath been favoured with an acquaintance and knowledg of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon earth it cannot without diſquietude live on earth, without it's Heaven.

What is ſaid of the great darkneſs which fell on <hi>Abraham</hi> in his ſleep, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.12. may be verified of all the deſertions which fall upon the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> they are attended with horrour and trouble. When God hid his face from <hi>David,</hi> he was troubled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.5. and his ſoul refuſed to be comforted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.2. his ſpirit was overwhelmed, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. ſo troubled he could not ſpeak, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.

So that when <hi>David</hi> had loſt the ſenſe of God's love, he could find peace or joy in nothing about him. An Idolater once expoſtulated with a

A Fourth and the laſt I ſhall now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a ſucceſſion of doubts and jealouſies leſt guilt and unworthineſs ſhould hinder his acceptance with God, and at laſt cut off his hope of every deſireable bleſſing from God. For although the believer is delivered from danger of condemnation, and hath had often experiences of the favour of his God, and is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44263:36"/>made upright and without prevailing guile in all his ſervices, which might in very reaſon be ſufficient ground of a conſtant peaceful hope, confidence and aſſurance that God will ever accept him, and delight to bleſs him, and at laſt reward him; yet for all this, many doubts, and the ſame frequently returning, do diſquiet the ſoul, putting it to ſuſpect the worſt, and what ſhall never befall it. Oh ſaith one, my ſins make me doubt, leſt that be my ſad ſtate which was <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s complaint, or ſhould have been in <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s words, <hi>Sins have hidden good things from me, Jer.</hi> 5.25.

                                 <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, for removal of the danger of condemnation, the firſt diſquietude mentioned there, is ſufficient in Chriſt dying our Sacrifice to effect this, as will appear on theſe Conſiderations.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. Chriſt dying our Sacrifice, was pleaſed to ſtand in our ſtead; he was ſubſtituted in our room, for us, in this he became what is neceſſary in every Sacrifice, a repreſentative of us for whom he made himſelf a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; ſo the Sacrifice doth <hi>vices ejus, qui reus agitur ſubire,</hi> take the place or turn of the guilty, of which ſubſtitution I have already ſpoken ſomewhat, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſect.</hi> 1. This Subſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Sacrifice was ſo generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an Opinion, and an inſeparate appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to every Sacrifice expiatory, that thou ſhall eaſily diſcerne it both in the writing of Heathens mentioning their Sacrifices as alſo in the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> relating the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of Jewiſh Sacrifices, if an ordinary care be uſed in reading. But I do not farther inſiſt on that, come we rather to ſee what quiet this ſubſtitution may afford to the ſoul, how full of peace may the ſoul be which can carry all that is laid to it's charge to Chriſt, which can ſay Chriſt ſtand's for me, is ſubſtituted in my ſtead; and if there be ought of danger, it firſt falleth on him, in whoſe hand never did any one miſcarry who had Chriſt undertaking for him. Chriſt now ſubſtitute for us ſtands between us and danger, who are thus in Chriſt [to allude to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.]
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44263:37"/>Are exempt from condemnation. For in this ſubſtitution of our Sacrifice there is.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. A due, ſufficient and full transferring our guilt on our Sacrifice, ſo that the guilty ſoul may now ſay; mercy hath tranſmitted my guilt from me upon my ſubſtitute, and he hath voluntarily taken that upon himſelf, to anſwer it before my Judge againſt all accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; and how then can condemnation be juſtly feared when no guilt is found lying upon the perſon? what ſervant, or child, needeth fear a chiding for that fault which the Maſter, or Father, hath on the interpoſing of a Mediatour transferred from the ſervant, or child? ſolicitous fears may <hi>de facto</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the ſoul, for whom Chriſt made himſelf a Sacrifice; but were ſuch fears arreſted, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and diſcovered, they would be checkt, diſcarded and caſt out as groundleſs; for it would then appear that they come intruders on innocent, acquitted, and imputatively guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoules. Doth any ſuch feare of future condemnation perplexe? look to thy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, conſider, guilt (which onely can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne) is by thy Judge in a valid, ſufficient form transferred from thee to thy Sacrifice, and certainly thy Judge will as juſtly acquit the from thy guilt, as he did mercifully transferre it, he whoſe mercy ſo contrived to make thee innocent, that thou mighteſt not be condemned. His Juſtice will find thee what mercy made thee, and thou ſhalt not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Read that text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Certainly then the danger of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44263:37"/>is over when we are made Righteous in Chriſt, and he our Sacrifice made ſin for us. The Righteous Judge of Heaven and earth will do ſo juſtly, that he will not codemn one whom grace hath made Righteous. Though all we like loſt-ſheep have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray, yet there is hope, for the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.16.</p>
                                 <p n="3">3. Chriſt our Sacrifice ſtanding in our ſtead, &amp; admitting the transferring of our guilt from us upon himſelf by his dying our ſacrifice did undergo that puniſhment, and did bear that wrath which our ſin deſerv'd that we might be abſolved and acquitted; ſo that now either we muſt doubt an after-puniſhment will be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us for the ſin Chriſt hath born and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and we ſhall be condemned, though he died to the end we might not be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which how little conſiſtant with either the juſtice of God or his mercy, any one may eaſily diſcern who will conſider. It is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of juſtice not to condemn a perſon for whom ſatisfaction hath been made; and it is matter of mercy to acquit him through ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſufferings, who ſtood condemned for his own offences; or if we judge, as fit we ſhould, that neither the juſtice or mercy of God will permit he ſhould be condemned for whom Chriſt died a Sacrifice, we can conclude no leſs from ſuch a death, than the abſolution &amp; future acquittance of a Believer, whoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice Chriſt died, who hereby <hi>hath</hi> (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4.) <hi>born our griefs, and carried our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, i. e.</hi> the puniſhment due to our ſins, for the which he hath ſuffered and made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.

The ſecond Diſquiet of the ſoul I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, was a fear leſt it ſhould loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing apprehenſions, and ſweet enjoyments of the Divine Favour; how much this would diſturb the peace of the ſoul, I am not here to diſcourſe, having ſaid all I intended alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on it. But now it is my buſineſs to ſhew that Chriſt's Death as our Sacrifice is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prevent this fear, or to ſecure unto the ſoul an enjoyment of the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44263:39"/>which I now attempt to ſhew.</p>
                                 <p n="1">1. In that this Sacrifice duly apprehended by us, doth very much abate of the ground of our fears, of the withdrawing the Divine Favour from us. Now the apprehenſion of the dread and terrour of ſpiritual deſertions ariſeth from our doubts, that they are but precurſory to a final and eternal diſpleaſure, that they are but the <hi>Primordia dolorum,</hi> the beginnings of ſorrows; that the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will be at laſt for everlaſting poured out upon the ſoul: Oh this afflicts! This, <hi>Will God be gracious no more?</hi> is the ſword which wounds to the heart? and whilſt this fear abides on the ſoul, it can take no reſt. Now ſee Chriſt our Sacrifice hath atoned vindictive diſpleaſure, reconciled us to God, delivered us from wrath to come; ſo that undoubtedly theſe preſent ſeaſons of darkneſs are but ſeaſons. Theſe ſorrows may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. Chriſt in the merit of his blood doth ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for me with God; though God appear not to me now as of old, yet I ſhall enjoy him.</p>
                                 <p n="2">2. Chriſt Dying a Sacrifice for us, hath now changed the nature of all our afflictions, and turned them into wholſom corrections, and into neceſſary exerciſes of our graces, not onely our outward afflictions are ſo changed, that there remaineth not any deadly poyſon in them, but our ſpiritual troubles among which this I ſpeak of, is to be accounted chief, theſe are much more altered in their nature, as indeed it was expedient they ſhould; for as they ſink deeper into the ſoul,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44263:39"/>and do more ſpeedily ſeize the ſpirit, and have an immediate influence on the ſoul, ſo they would be of more dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if they retained an unrebated poyſon in them; Theſe would undo the ſoul, whereas outward afflictions can approach to the ſoul but intermediately, and being kept ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the outworks, can only diſquiet &amp; alarm cannot kill the ſoul nor its comforts. Now we are beholden to the excellency of this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for this. By this ſacrifice our afflictions are rendered only corrections whatever is vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and which the ſoul cannot beare is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon our Sacrifice, being hereby ſecured from wrath. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life, Rom.</hi> 5.10. The Apoſtle argueth from our reconciliation once effected, unto our ſalvation in due time to be accompliſht. And happy they who have Chriſt once dying a Sacrifice to make their peace, but ever living a merciful and a faithful High Prieſt to maintain their peace with God.

Although it is true, ſo many culpable defects adhere to our duties, that God might in the ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, juſtly reject them; yet he will not impute theſe defects to the perſons, nor for them reject the duties of his Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Chriſt's Sacrifice he hath received an atonement, and will pardon thoſe defects an atonement, and will pardon thoſe defects to his children. Let us then hold faſt our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of particular hope, and delight in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as of the general Doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Seeing we have a great High Prieſt, who is paſſed into the Heavens Jeſus the Son of God,</hi>

This Sacrifice gives the believer a juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able title to every mercy whether temporal or ſpiritual, that he is capable of receiving, and enjoying with ſafety, and good to himſelf, as with gloty to God; and if any one particular mercy, notwithſtanding the believers deſire of it, and earneſt labour after it, be with-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it is becauſe his weak foreſight, and ſmall ſcantling of wiſdom cannot diſcern what the All-ſeeing Eye of God doth ſee, and what his Infinite Wiſdom knows, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is fitteſt for the preſent to with-hold that particular deſired mercy, and to reſerve it unto a ſeaſon wherein it will be a choicer mercy, and more advantageous. Now a ſmall meaſure of patience might quiet the heart in the abſence of ſuch bleſſings, if the man would reflect upon his condition ſo well ſetled by Chriſt his Sacrifice, that he hath by this a title to every good, and that the time and the manner of entring on the poſſeſſion of this good is aſſigned by the Lord in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt love to us, that we ſhould not by our haſte ſnatch an unſeaſonable bleſſing, nor by our ſloth loſe a ſeaſonable mercy.

                     <head>REVIVAL OF GRACE: FROM <hi>Conſideration of Chriſt Dying a Teſtator.</hi> PART II.</head>
                     <p>Among ſome other Conſiderations of Chriſt's Death, let me acquaint you with this, that Chriſt Dyed a Teſtator; one peculiar, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular circumſtance in his dying was this, that he was to die, and by death confirm his laſt Will and Teſtament; and this is very fit, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and proper for a Sacramental medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is a very fit and ſeaſonable object, and matter for our meditations at a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from whence our graces may be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44263:47"/>actuated and improved. In order whereunto I ſhall do theſe five things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew that Chriſt did die as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, as a loving careful friend, making his Will. Next,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Remembrance of this kind of Death of our Lord, doth well ſuit with a Sacrament. Next,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That ſuch a Remembrance will advance grace in its growth; this more general. Next,</p>
                     <p n="4">4. What particular graces the renewed Remembrance of Chriſt dying, and ordaining his laſt Will or Teſtament, will advance and improve. And Laſtly,</p>
                     <p n="5">5. What are the ſingular motives proper to each of the forementioned graces, and peculiarly ariſing from this kind of Death, which improve grace. All which I will with what brevity and plainneſs I can diſpatch in ſo many Chapters.</p>

                        <p>THE Firſt thing which I ſtand bound unto, is the clearing of the truth of this Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Foundation of my diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt Dying, did Die as a loving and careful Friend, conſidering the ſtate, and providing by Will for the future good of his kindred and people; Chriſt Dying, died as a Teſtator, as one ordaining his laſt Teſtament.

Now having thus loved his own, he loved them to the end; and love hath a good memory, it will not eaſily forget. I am ſure Chriſt did neither abate of his love, nor forget them he loved, which perſwadeth me to conclude, that this great Heir ſo dearly loving his poor kindred, would certainly provide for them, and leave a Will or Teſtament behind him, which they ſhould all be the better for; which I the rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to believe he would do, becauſe</p>

In a word, he as well knew his friends needed he ſhould give to them, as he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44263:49"/>knew his enemies needed he ſhould forgive them; as he did in pity pray for the one, ſo he did in love and care provide for the other. And dying friends uſually do provide in their laſt Will or Teſtament, eſpecially if they have what Chriſt had.</p>

In ſum, Chriſt had time enough wherein to do this; he had good will enough to move him to it; he had eſtate enough to furniſh and enrich them, and his poor kindred had need enough. And what then think we could hinder him from making his Will; or what ſhould diſſwade us from believing it?</p>

Note well how Chriſt's laying down his life, <hi>i. e.</hi> Dying for his ſheep, is is ſet down as one cauſe why the Father did ſo love him. Now becauſe the Father loved him, he hath given, or put all things into his hand, <hi>John</hi> 3.35. Left them all to his diſpoſal. Theſe two places of St. <hi>John</hi> do in effect ſpeak this very language, That the voluntary Death of Chriſt ſhould procure his Father's love to him, and this love of his Father ſhould beſtow a power and right on Chriſt to diſpoſe of all things. All which was exactly, and punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Chriſt after his Death, as well as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44263:50"/>largely promiſed, and contracted for, upon condition that he ſhould die; the promiſe was made on condition he would die, and the right to all contained in the promiſe, was conferred upon him, becauſe he died, and this right is expreſſed by St. <hi>John</hi> thus, he hath put all things into his hand, becauſe he loved him, and he loved him becauſe he laid down his life. Thus Chriſt acquired a right over all by his Death, and at his Death diſpoſed of it for the good and benefit of his people, whom he made his Heir by Will or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is yet farther confirmed by theſe two places, <hi>viz.

Now I have ſufficiently proved, that Chriſt did make his laſt Will, and that he died a Teſtator; the Sacrament of his laſt Supper is a ſhewing forth this Death; and unto this do your thoughts agree, when they run out into Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations on Chriſt dying and making his laſt Will.

Our great, and Glorious Captain knowing that his hour was come and that he muſt dye for us; diſpoſed thus his eſtate by VVill or Teſtament, which proveth the truth of his Death as fully as any VVill duly proved by courſe of Law proveth that the Teſtator is dead. Now certainly good evidence to the truth of Chriſt's death muſt needs be very ſuitable to our publick declaration and Profeſſion of his death and ſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44263:54"/>muſt ſuit with this firſt End of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is to ſhew forth his Death until he come. The valid and irreverſible Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment proveth the Death of the Teſtator. Now ſuch a Teſtament we have exhibited in the Sacrament; and who employs his thoughts on this meditation, employs them ſo as they agree with the End of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Secondly, Chriſt intended the renewal of our lively affections toward him Dying for us as another end of the Sacrament of his body and blood. He did therefore appoint this Ordinance to continue after his Death, that it might keep the affectionate remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his love alive in our hearts. He would not have his Death forgotten, neither would he have it kept in memory without the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſtrength of our love. His friends were dead in ſin and miſery; at that time he remembred theſe dead friends with life of affections, and now his living friends muſt not remember him with dead affection. A lifeleſs affection is next neighbour to no affection; and to remember with ſuch affection, is very little more than quite to forget. Now none of us ſhould ſo forget our Dying Lord; we could not ſee him dying as they did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 27. who followed him to Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and ſaw him with their bodily eyes; yet in every Sacrament of his Supper he is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth dying among us; and ſo every one of us muſt remember him; every place in the Church may put us in mind of our Lord; but the Table and the Croſs do more particularly and lively ſet our remembrance
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44263:55"/>on work, <hi>Sic oculos! Sic ille manus!</hi> &amp;c. Let me ask the queſtion, did you ever loſe a dear friend who made you a Legatee in his Will? or appointed you Executor of it? how did your affections ſtir, move, yea melt your heart when you read over the Will? when you came to demand your Legacy, did you receive it with dry eyes? Let us beſtow our affections in reading over Chriſt's Will, as we would beſtow them in reading over the Will of a tender careful Friend, and then I am ſure we ſhall frame our hearts to this ſecond end of the Lord's ſupper, and demean our ſelves as Chriſt expects we ſhould at his table. We ſhall remember him with love for his loving remembrance of us; we ſhall remember him with deſires of his return and coming in glory to make good all that he hath bequeathed to us, to put us in poſſeſſion of all that which the Sacrament repreſenteth and ſealeth to us, we ſhall ſay make haſt come quickly oh! Lord.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Thirdly, A ſolemn, publick and conſtant return of Thanks and Praiſe to the Lord, is a third end of this Sacrament.

When a very rich giſt is given by Will upon conditions and reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all revoked from every claimer who performeth not thoſe conditions, and diſpoſed to others who will do, and have done and performed the conditions; how great care and diligence doth this awaken? how ſpeedy is the conſidering Legatee! what haſte doth he make to perform! leſt non-performance of his duty ſhould diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point his hope, and cut off his claim. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thou haſt the Inheritance given by Will, and that Will preſcribes thee thy duty; and if ever thou intendeſt to put in claim for it, look thou put thy hand ſpeedily to the doing of what is there enjoyned thee.

Every Miniſter of Chriſt is one by whom Chriſt ſtill pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth this Will of his. Now if thou who readeſt this, hadſt ſuch a Ground of Plea for an inheritance; wouldſt thou not ſay, thou hadſt a good Title? wouldſt thou fear to claim thy Legacy? wouldſt thou not ſue the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor rather than loſe thine inheritance? when thou ſhouldeſt read what thy dying Friend commanded to be written, what witneſſes are to it, how plain and full he made every thing be written &amp; publiſht, would not thy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion grow as thou readeſt? So then it is in this caſe, every promiſe is reduced into the form of a will, and the more thou readeſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt, the more wilt thou diſcern the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and the certainty of the promiſes. The words which thou believeſt, &amp; on which thou may'ſt claim, and make good thy claim to any promiſe, it is the Legacy thy dying Lord hath bequeathed thee. Say then before thou goeſt to the Lords Table, I am now prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to renew the memorial of Chriſts death, and what thoughts am I to entertain? ought they not to be thoughts of the precious promiſes which are compriſed in the Lord Jeſus, in whom they are all yea and amen, made to us in him before he died; made moſt ſure to us by him when he died. And who dares go about to reverſe what he hath ſo conſirmed? who ſhall preſume to annul and make void his will? I ſee others believe their intereſt in the laſt will of their Friends: I know I am the Friend of Chriſt, and in his Will, what then ſhould make me doubt?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44263:66"/>Nay I will endeavour to have as <hi>inviolatam fidem,</hi> inviolate and unſhaken Faith as I have inviolate and Sacred ground of Faith in the laſt Will of my Lord.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, The Believer hath yet more to increaſe his faith, and to confirm him in the perſwaſion that there ſhall be a performance of all that is promiſed. For it is all made ſure by the laſt Teſtament of him who could not exceed his own treaſures; he hath not given larger Legacies than his eſtate will bear; though his Gifts are great, yet his Eſtate will make them good. He is heir of both Worlds, with all that is in both: he is heir of the world to come; and he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary of all grace which fits for Glory; and he is alſo Proprietary of all Glory fitted unto Grace, that is prepared and apportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto Grace. He is Lord of this preſent world: although we do not yet ſee all things put under him, yet he is the man of whom <hi>David</hi> ſpake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. witneſs the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. He ſhall inherit all Nations: he is a King, whoſe dominion is over all. In one word, the greateſt wants, the largeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, the higheſt expectations of his kindred could not be too much for his Treaſures. Though none ever gave as he hath given; yet none ever did or ever ſhall be put to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or to forgo any part of his Gift. This oh believing ſoul is! peculiar to thy Lord; his Riches will pay all his Legacies.</p>
                           <p>Say then to thine unbelief, what is it thou ſtickeſt at? where lieth the difficulty? are the promiſes ſo rich, they exceed the Eſtates and Treaſures of this world? do they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44263:67"/>to more than all the world can make up? why ſtill they are not greater than the Riches of both worlds: and remember thy ſelf; he hath both this, and that world which is to come, at his diſpoſal, and his Bequeſts are to be disburſed and paid out of both:

He hath diſpoſed of them to his, as they need, as they deſire, as they want, or wiſh. And that they might be ſure, hath ordained them by his laſt Will a Legacy for all who underſtand, deſire, ſeek and wait for them; and leſt any doubt ſhould diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you, I pray you remember; Chriſt the wiſdom of his Father could not want ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient skill, and Chriſt Dying for us could not want good will to ordain his Teſtament, ſo that none ſhould diſappoint or defeat it in part or in whole.

                              <note place="margin">Dan. 5.27.</note> thou art found too light to be weighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the confidences and perſwaſions of a Believer; for all other Legacies are the gifts of the dead, but the Believers Legacies are the gifts of him who was dead, but is alive, and liveth for ever more. Others may have the aſſurance of an unchangeable Teſtament, and ordination of their will, but yet want an aſſurance of juſt and faithfull execution of it. If their Friend be dead, the Legacy is due and cannot be recalled. But their Friend is dead, &amp; poſſibly the Legacy may never be paid: here's that defect which makes it too light to be weighed with the believers confidence, which is as ſure, for his Friend was dead to confirm, and is yet ſurer than all others, for his Friend
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44263:69"/>doth live. Chriſt will make all ſure (as we ſay) his own eyes ſhall be overſeers, and his own hands executors of his own Will.</p>
                           <p>Now then at the Lords Table view the riches of the promiſes, take a particular of what is contained in them, a particular of what grace, what conſolation, what glory, ſay, All theſe are (by the laſt Will of my Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lord) beſtowed upon me. I may claim them, I may ſue and plead for them, I may avow my title to them; for they are a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy given to me by my Lord: and who then can change or alter his VVill which hath been ratified by his Death? or who ſhall dare to violate it, and defeat me? or any other Believer? So long as my Lord liveth to prevent the attempt, and to avenge himſelf for the violence; Oh that our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the truth of the Promiſes were firm and ſtedfaſt as the Promiſes themſelves! Oh that we could give more credit to the Promiſes, as God hath given us more argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inducements to credit them! well Reader, I know not how my weak and dark reaſoning with thee doth prevail; but I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, there is in the Promiſes a moſt ſure and unfailing truth aſſerted and declared to thee by this, That they are the bequeſts of Chriſt Jeſus, who ever lives to make them good. Remember this at the Sacrament, where the Promiſes are all tendered to thee in Chriſt, I doubt not it will ſtrengthen thy Faith.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. Fifthly, Conſider, <hi>the Promiſes are the Legacies of thy friend, who would not alter his Will, and diſpoſe of them otherwiſe than he
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44263:69"/>hath already diſpoſed them. He is yeſterday,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.8.</note> to day and for ever the ſame,</hi> in his love, care, wiſdom and bounty; were he now to make his laſt VVill, he would not alter any thing; he would not blot out one name, nor abate any one Legacy. I ſtand the leſs to prove this, becauſe nothing can fall out to change infinite wiſdom; and ſuch was the wiſdom of Chriſt who is the Teſtator, and diſpoſed all as you ſee them diſpoſed. And in this appeareth a certainty in Divine Promiſes, which is (ſeldom? nay) never found in the promiſes of men, although confirmed by an irrevocable Teſtamentary diſpoſition; for it ſeems paſt doubt, that if any one of the rich and wealthy Princes, or Grandees of the world, were to live again, and to ordain their VVills anew, they would alter much, leaving out ſome, abating to others, &amp;c. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon diſcovery of unworthineſs in the Legatees, or upon diſcovery of other perſons and uſes more excellent; all which would proceed from experience, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; the leaſt of which cannot be ſuppoſed, or found in Chriſt. He would do what he hath done, were it all to be done over again. Now this doth add new evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the certainty of the Promiſe, and ought to add new degrees of ſtrength to our Faith. How ſure muſt thoſe Promiſes be which are the Promiſes of one unchangable, and who repenteth nothing which he hath ſpoken! Away then with unbelief and doubts baniſh them all from thy ſoul. If thou wouldſt but love thy Lord in truth of heart; if thou grieveſt for thy deadneſs and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proficiency;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44263:70"/>if thou ſtriveſt to walk more worthy of thy relation unto Chriſt, and of his love to thee; be not too much dejected. Thy Lord foreſaw this, and hath provided a pardon for, and help againſt it; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the baſeneſs thou confeſſeſt and bewaileſt in thy ſelf, Chriſt would make the ſame VVill if he were to make it anew, and give thee as much as he hath done. Raiſe up thy Faith therefore, and at the Sacrament be think thy ſelf; Here are the Promiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the form of a laſt VVill, that they might be ſure; and they are ſo diſpoſed by my Lord who foreſaw all that can diſcourage me, and who would not change any thing, were all to be new done. Surely he intends as he ſpeaketh; is in very good earneſt; he will perform that at laſt, which he would not change or alter in the leaſt. Oh then! I muſt perſwade my ſelf it is all truth which is in theſe Promiſes, and I ſhould believe them more ſtedfaſtly if I did underſtand them more clearly. <hi>None can have ſuch equal ground of believing his friend; none ſhall equal me in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Chriſt my friend and Lord.</hi>

No man is judge in the caſe and plea of right between thoſe he hath made joint Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatees, but one is the Teſtator, and dieth; another is the Judge and interpreter of the Teſtament whence it doth not ſeldom fall out that the Legatees are defeated of their right, and loſe the gift of their Friend; and the mind of the Teſtator is not fulfilled becauſe it is either not underſtood by the judge, or becauſe it muſt not be underſtood (although indeed it is well enough known) this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaves ſome uncertainty in a man's claim, and the event upon trial is ſometime a diſappointment. But here is no ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in the event, for he is Judge who is Teſtator, and he is to declare his own mind, of whom we expect the gift, and who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly doth well underſtand his own mind. Beſides, in expecting and claiming, the Legatee ſhall aſſuredly have all the favour ſhewed him that hee needeth. It is a rule in law, that <hi>wills ſhould be interpreted in the more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe. That love which was ſo great to give the Legacy, will be great enough to adjudge it to the Legatee.</hi> Moreover it is not poſſible that a caſe ſhould ariſe between the Legatees of Chriſt wherein the one ſhould gain, and the other loſe, for ſuch are the gifts of Chriſt that they are intire and whole to each one; none hath the leſs for any ones having much; ſo the controverſy ſhall never be but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44263:71"/>the ſoul and its unbeleif, fears, and doubts: between the ſoul, and Satan accuſing and impleading it. And in this caſe Chriſt being Judge of his own Will, you may ſoon ſay what favourable, gracious and merciful judgement he will give; and how ſurely he will adjudge their title good, whoſe faith, love and deſires ſue for it to him. Awaken thy ſelf then! and look on what ſure ground thou ſtandeſt! who haſt Promiſes ſo full of certainty and unchangeable truth. Let thy ſoul admit no more unbelief than the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (confirmed by Chriſt framing them into his laſt VVill and Teſtament,) do admit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. <hi>Let not unbelief enter until thou ſeeſt uncertainty attend thine expectation from the Will of Chriſt.</hi> Reaſon with thy ſoul; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the caſe to thy ſerious thoughts.

Fear not oh believing ſoul! thy claim will be adjudged good; doubt not thy Plea of right, he is Judge who gave thee the right; ſtagger not through unbeleef. <hi>He did deſignedly give thee all aſſurance poſſible, not to prevent any unfaithfulneſs in himſelf but, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all infidelity in thee.</hi> Not to confirm his own word by any new arguments, or new bonds which might be ſure to hold if others did break; for his word, and promiſe is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs and truth; but to confirm thy faith, and that if unbeleef broke through ſome, yet it might not break through others; if it did prevail with the ſoul againſt any one, it might not prevail againſt every one of the encouragements and perſwaſives to believe. Weigh well the certainty of thoſe promiſes which are confirmed by the laſt will of ſuch, (I ſay, of ſuch) a Teſtator who changeth not, who cannot be overruled by any ſuperiour Judge, and then ſay how great your perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the truth of them ſhould be.

The Promiſe which the Lord makes to us (for I ſpeak of a Divine hope) in which Promiſe there is <hi>(ratio veri)</hi> undoubted truth, and there is <hi>(ratio boni)</hi> deſirable good. The former St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth thus; <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44263:73"/>lattet St. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſeth thus, <hi>Exceeding great and precious Promiſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And the Royal Prophet hath excellently joyned both together, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.28. The word of God (which was the Promiſe made to <hi>David</hi> by the Lord in the mouth of <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet) is true and good. Now as Faith ſprings up and flouriſheth on the truth of the Promiſe; ſo Hope ſprings up and flouriſheth on the goodneſs of the Promiſe; or in the words of the Learned PP. of <hi>Saumur.</hi>

                              <hi>Indeed Faith embraceth the Promiſe as it appears,

Sect. 47.</note> and is true; but Hope conſidereth the Promiſe as it is, and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be good and future.</hi> And this notion of Hope is warranted by the Sciptures. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Hope, determines it unto good as its proper object, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. By Hope we are ſaved, ſalvation is a great good, and to this the Chriſtian Hope applyeth it ſelf. It is a Bleſſed Hope, that is a Hope of Bleſſedneſs at the glorious appearing of Chriſt our Saviour, <hi>Titus,</hi> 2.13. Thus the Apoſtle deſcribeth the object of a believers Hope as it is good, and in both places he includes the futurity of this good, and makes it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of good as it is hoped; for Hope that is ſeen is not Hope,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.24.</note> ſaith the Apoſtle, &amp;c. So then let the notion of Hope be remembred, that we may ſee the influence of the laſt Will of out Dying Lord giving life, and growth to our Hopes. If our hopes are an expectation, we may expect what Chriſt hath given, if an expectation of great good, Chriſt's gift by
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44263:73"/>will cannot but be a great good: if this great good muſt be future and poſſible, it cannot but be yet to come, for we cannot receive all in this preſent life; but what is future is poſſible, yea ſure, (though unſeen and to be attained with difficulty). <hi>Chriſt will inveſt every believer with that which he hath bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed to him in his laſt Will.</hi> But I paſs from this general diſcourſe unto the particular diſcuſſing of the ſtrength and growth of our Hope when it is acted on Chriſt's laſt Will and Teſtament, in which the conſiderate ſoul obſerveth.</p>

But where a great heart poſſeſſeth an eſtate, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth an intereſs, and enjoyeth opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, large as its ſelf; there are ever great deſigns, rich promiſes, vaſt expectations; and theſe give being to a hope that maketh not aſhamed. The favorites of Kings enlarge their hopes to the greatneſs of thoſe gifts their Princes uſe to give. It were a diſhonour to a Prince if his Friend and favourite ſhould hope for a mean and poor gift, ſuch as every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary man beſtows upon his Friend.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 22.7.</note> 
                                 <hi>Saul</hi> ſpake more like a King beſtowing gifts, when he talked of olive-yards, and vine-yards, and making them Captains over thouſands. And the ambitious mother meaſured her hope and requeſt for her ſons, by the greatneſs of their maſters ſtate, when ſhe begged that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44263:74"/>they might ſit the one on the right hand, the other on the left hand of their Lord in his Kingdom. So let our hopes eye the riches and treaſures of our Dying Lord, and grow great as his mind and good will, as his means and ability to enrich us, to ſatisfy us with moſt excellent Legacies, with Royall gifts.</p>
                              <p n="3">3. <hi>As his mind and means were great, ſo was his love and affections toward us. Jonathan</hi>'s love to <hi>David</hi> was a love that exceeded the love of women, but fell ſhort of the love of Chriſt to believers. It is hard to find a love that may ſhadow out the love of Chriſt, but it is impoſſible to find out a love that can equal it, or ſet it forth to us in its gaeatneſs. It is greater than the love of a Friend, a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a Father, a wife; greater than all theſe, could we compound them all into one. Now where ſo great love to us, in ſo great eſtate in the hands of ſo great mind, there out hopes cannot but exceed the hopes of a man who hath the largeſt hopes from his Friend, his Brother, or Father. He knows not the heart of Chriſt, nor the riches of Chriſt, nor the love of Chriſt, who contents himſelf with ſmall hopes, or doth not enlarge his heart towards a hope, great as the love of Chriſt. See then what thou mayeſt expect ſhould be thy legacy; think what it likely ſhould be that Chriſt Dying would beſtow upon thee; would he not give the greateſt he could? ſhould you not hope the greateſt you are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of? do not men (cloſe handed, narrow hearted, and loath to leave what they have), do they not give the moſt they can to thoſe they love moſt at their death? have not they

But on the other ſide, the believers Hope, (through the death and Teſtament of Chriſt) hath in it goodneſs as well as greatneſs; goodneſs to ſweeten our Hope, and to ſanctify our enjoyment; the unbelievers Hope and acquiſition, makes the eſtate greater, and the perſon viler; but this of the believer makes his eſtate more great, and his perſon more gracious; it makes him happier in his poſſeſſions, and holier in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and ſo betters both the man and his condition. In this the believers Hope excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all other which will, I hope clearly appear, if at a Sacrament we meditate on.</p>
                              <p n="1">1. Firſt the Moral goodneſs and excellency of thoſe things which Chriſt hath willed to us, they are full of purity, and therefore full of lovelineſs. If Moral vertue were ſo deſirable in the eye of the Philoſopher that he could ſay every one would fall in love with it, if it were, or could be ſet forth in its native beauty to the eye, what then will the Holineſs of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44263:76"/>Chriſt's Legacies be to a gracious ſoul? what will Moral vertue (whereof Chriſt's Legacies are full) enhaunced, and dignified with the addition of grace (which Chriſt doth adde to his Legacies) <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>The ſpirit of truth.</hi> Behold here a Legacy which bequeaths all Moral vertues, and all ſanctifying graces at once; in this one gift you have greater and choicer gifts than all the world can give. Here is greatneſs, and riches; here is goodneſs, and righteouſneſs. In one word, the great gifts of dying friends have corrupted many a fair and well tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered nature, but lo! here's a Legacy greater then all thoſe, and which hath rectifyed and beautifyed many a crooked and vitiated nature. <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them fom the evill, Joh.</hi> 17.15.</p>
                              <p>Now as he praies it may be ſo with them, he powerfully worketh upon them, and it is ſo with them, they are kept from the evil: For he imparteth thoſe internal operative excellencies to his living Friends which firſt filled his pure ſoul; <hi>of him we receive grace for grace;</hi> And <hi>he becomes a quickening ſpirit.</hi> and as he took upon him our Nature that he might ſuffer for us, ſo he imparteth his Holy Spirit, maketh us partakers of the Divine Nature, that we might reign with him; and in all this he excelleth: for only Chriſt can by Will and Teſtament make over, and impart the endowments which adorn the mind. Thy learned Friend may bequeath to thee his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44263:76"/>eſtate, his bookes, but he cannot give thee his learning; thy Chriſtian parent may diſpoſe an ample eſtate to thee, but he cannot be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged to diſpoſe a drachm of his grace unto thee. But here is ſuch a Friend who might warrantably, and who hath graciouſly ſaid, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo, Joh.</hi> 14.16. For he can give a ſpiritual life in holineſs, and grace, and he can preſerve and finiſh it; he can at laſt alſo give an eternal life in glory and happineſs; this he giveth to all who are given to him by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. This is the Moral ſpiritual goodneſs of his gift which renders not onely the condition of the perſon, but the diſpoſition of the mind better, and which excels no leſs than vertue excels wealth, no leſs than the mind excels the body, or grace and Heaven, excel gold and earth.</p>
                              <p n="2">2. <hi>A goodneſs of reſt, peace and Satisfaction attends the greatneſs of this Legacy.</hi> (I do wittingly change the terms which the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would here have uſed, and do rather chuſe to call it as I have done, a goodneſs of reſt, or peace, or ſatisfaction.) 1. The poſſibility that our great hopes may be attended with great anxieties and dangers. 2. The danger leſt they ſhould turn to troubles and diſquietudes as great as our Hopes. 3. The uncertainty which will be moſt, our happineſs that we meet with, or our unhappineſs that we miſs of, our great worldly expectations and Hopes. 4. Finally the moſt undoubted certainty that our great worldly Hopes ſhall not, and that indeed they cannot, afford us a commenſurate reſt, and that our largeſt expectations ſhall (like rivell'd half withered fruit) give the

There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the greatneſs of a believers Hope to abate the goodneſs of it; for it is a Hope which at laſt will give an everlaſting reſt. It ſhall never make aſhamed. It is bequeathed to us in thoſe words of our Lord; <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you that in me ye might have peace, Joh.</hi> 16.33. Oh deſireable gift! peace in Chriſt! were it no more than peace, yet would it be more than our richeſt, mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, wiſeſt Friends could give us: their Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are often an occaſion of trouble, jarrs, and bitter contention, ſeldom a cauſe of peace to us in our outward affairs; never a cauſe of peace to us in our ſoul. The peace of ſoul muſt be ſought in Chriſt, and behold here it is bequeathed to us! farther yet, it is a peace or reſt with Chriſt in glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory.</hi> Where we ſhall be like him both in his reſt, and in his glory into which he is entred to take poſſeſſion for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for believers.

It is reported of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> that they had no deſire to poſſeſs <hi>Italy</hi> until they had taſted the ſweet grapes of the <hi>Italian</hi> Vines; ſo ſoon as they had taſted, they ſtrongly deſire, ſuddenly reſolve, and vigorouſly attempt the conqueſt of it; ſo is it here, total abſence and ignorance quencheth our deſire, but a partial knowledg, and taſte enflameth it. <hi>They deſire more who

But indeed, theſe are now ſmall to what they are to be hereafter. Theſe preſent disburſments are from Chriſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his own will, as the disburſments of an executour entruſted with orphanes whoſe breeding muſt be paid for out of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, but the Legacy muſt be paid into their owne hands at full age. Oh how doth ſuch one deſire, and long for theſe two things (1.) that he had greater interreſs in the affections and favour of ſuch an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and (2.) that his full age were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht that he might have the full ſtate in his own hand. So doth the preſent enjoyment of Chriſt's allowance ſet the ſoul on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireing more intereſs in Chriſt, that his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of grace, peace and comfort may be greater; And then, That which is abſent, (which indeed is far the grater and better part) that which the ſoul is fetching in by deſires, that (which it wiſheth becauſe it wanteth,) doth make it wiſh for that full age which alone ſhall receive the full, rich and glorious Legacies. Theſe are the common incentives of deſire which uſually prevail with us to wiſh and deſire. Theſe are to be found as much, nay more in theſe bequeathed gifts than in the beſt objects of natural, or meer moral, or unſanctified rational deſires. Are the objects of ſuch deſires thought to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44263:84"/>be good? yet are they not comparable in goodneſs with the gifts Chriſt bequeaths to us.</p>
                              <p>Are thoſe poſſible? and may they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? ſo are theſe: And ſomewhat more then poſſibile, they are fairly, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly probable.</p>
                              <p>Are thoſe well tempered with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent taſte and with a greater ſweetneſs to be delighted in for future? yet in this they infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall ſhort of future ſweetneſs to be taſted in the gifts of Chriſt. And this brief compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the different degrees of deſireableneſs in theſe different objects ſhould lead me to a larger diſcourſe of the tranſcendency of the one above the other, but I will content my ſelf to ſhew in as few words as poſſibly I can this one thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas other men are content to deſire good upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of obtaining, or with perplexity in deſiring, and withall at laſt do poſſeſs with unſatisfied minds. The deſiers of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſoul excelleth in all theſe.</p>

His willingneſs makes it certain; But I mention three things more;</p>
                              <p n="1">1. <hi>The form of his Will and laſt Teſtament,</hi> which is <hi>ſo made, that there is room for all deſirous, longing ſoules,</hi> the Invitations, the Call, the perſwaſives, the promiſes, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Goſpel run ſo general, that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44263:84"/>he is no Chriſtian who knows not that there is room for the deſires of every believer; other mens wills framed, ſealed and publiſht, exclude all but thoſe which are mentioned in them. Chriſt's will is ſo framed, that thou, and I, and every hearty willing ſoul may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our names for a Legacy, and receive it; and farther, though none elſe, yet</p>
                              <p n="2">2. <hi>All the kindred of Chriſt are compriſed in his will,</hi> which kindred are not by naturall generation, but by gracious Adoption, and ſo it may be enlarged by new additions of new Friends. Thus thy hearty deſires will ſurely enroll thee among the kindred of Chriſt, ſo thou mayeſt certainly (if the fault be not thine own) be of the alliance, kindred and family of Chriſt, and as certainly be ſharer among others of the Legacies given by Chriſt, who laſtly hath left</p>
                              <p n="3">3. <hi>Aſſets to pay every Legatee; he hath grace enough to make good the Legacies of grace; He hath merit enough to make good the Legacy of juſtification; he hath the fulneſs of the ſpirit of holineſs to ſatisfy the claim of every one who would perfect holineſs; he hath glory great enough, and crowns many enough to crown and glorify;</hi> and ſo to make good all his Legacies which concern the glorifying of believers. This is the certainty of thy future obtaining thy deſires, if thou doſt heartily deſire. And who would not pray, and ſtrive after thoſe deſires which ſhall certainly be ſo fullfilled? uncertainties awaken other mens deſires, and ſhall thy deſires oh Chriſtian! ſleep and dye when they have ſuch encouragements? nay farther yet.</p>
                              <pb n="161" facs="tcp:44263:85"/>
                              <p n="2">2. <hi>Other deſires are attended with perplexing anxieties and cares.</hi> They grow among thorns, and pierce the very heart; it is not eaſy to diſcern whether they diſquiet moſt in the failure, and diſappointment at laſt; or in the ſolicitous longings of the heart whileſt they are expected; there is trouble more than enough in both the wracking deſire, and in the killing diſappointment: Now thy <hi>deſires</hi> (O chriſtian!) <hi>after a portion in theſe Legacies</hi> of Chriſt <hi>excel in theſe two</hi> things; <hi>firſt when they commence and turn into enjoyments, they do not diſappoint,</hi> and next, <hi>whileſt they are deſires, they afford and give ſome good meaſure of ſatisfaction to the ſoul.</hi> For they are deſires fixed upon a good which is in ſome degree already enjoyed; <hi>Chriſt and his benefits are ever enjoyed whileſt ſincerely deſired.</hi> Theſe meſſengers of the ſoul ſeeking for Chriſt are ſent by Chriſt himſelf who is with the ſoul, much as he was incognito with the Diſciples before he made himſelf known in breaking of bread.

Awake! oh my ſoul! and before thou make thy approach to the Lord's table, look over the laſt Will and Teſtament of Chriſt thy Lord; ſee there is pardoning mercy to take away death which is the deſert of ſin; there is purifying mercy to take away the filth of ſin, to dry up the poiſonous fountain of ſin; there is pacifying mercy to take away inward diſtracting trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; there is interceding mercy to procure acceptance of all the good thou doſt; there is preſerving mercy to keep thee from falling away and periſhing; there is crowning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to encourage thy expectations, and ſatisfy thy beſt and largeſt deſires. In a word, here is Chriſt's Spirit, his Righteouſneſs, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with eternal life given by Will and laſt Teſtament, and all theſe tendered to thee as Chriſt's Miniſter tenders the body and blood
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44263:86"/>of Chriſt to thee: all theſe things are delivered to thee in the copy of Chriſt's will, ſealed unto thee at the Sacrament; and thy deſires are now expected. Good things, and poſſible, yea certain, and enſured to thee, (if thou wilt but heartily deſire them.) Awake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſincere wiſh, a ſtrong longing after them that they might ſtatisfy thee. All theſe are thine if thou wilt be Chriſt's; oh then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire he would unite thee to himſelf that thou may'ſt be one among them that are one with Chriſt; theſe ſhall be heirs to theſe great things; theſe muſt be of Chriſt's kindred and alliance; this alliance is not by natural conſanguinity, it is by a foederal covenant Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this Union is effected by us for our part by willingneſs and deſire; ſay then, art thou willing to loſe and miſs theſe great things? or doſt thou think them unworthy of thy deſire? or rather doſt thou not wiſh thou couldeſt deſire them? doſt thou not feel thy heart kindly bubling forth ſuch affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſires as theſe after Chriſt? oh that I were of that happy family which are ſo bleſſed with Chriſt! oh that my name were written in the will! oh that there were a blank where I might ſecretly or openly write mine own name there, then I would as <hi>Jacob</hi> (yet without offence) ſteal a bleſſing! oh that there were ſome would ſhew me how I might imbody my ſelf with this houſhold and kindred! why now if ſuch deſires ſtir, behold here is a ſhort, but a ſure method: <hi>Longings and deſires after nearer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and cloſer conjunction with Chriſt, heary deſires of communion with Chriſt will do this great work,

But the grace of love to Chriſt, with an high eſteem of the perſon and concernments of Chriſt, is ſo needful, that whoſoever either loves him not, or loves him not for his own ſake, is unworthy of this great ordinance. It is diſputed whether <hi>Judas</hi> did partake of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but it is not diſputable whether a heart like his, whether a man or woman who loves Chriſt no more than <hi>Judas</hi> did love him, be fit for the Sacrament.

Now in the Teſtament or laſt Will of Chriſt we may diſcern moſt evidently</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>A love which deſerveth to be very highly prized, a love toward us wich none but Chriſt ever did or could bear and expreſs toward us:</hi> A love which entitled us to a participation of a Kingdom, for as the Father hath given a Kingdom to him, ſo hath he given a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom unto us; herein appeareth the largeneſs of his love to us; what he hath given decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth how much he loved, and the time when he gave ſheweth the conſtancy of his love to us; he loved us to the laſt.

The vaſt riches of ſome men have been kept cloſe until their laſt will hath diſcovered them, and how then have ſome men admired them? indeed we cannot underſtand the full treaſures of our bleſſed Lord until we come to read his laſt Will and Teſtament in the light of glory with eyes of immortality, and then he ſhall be admired in all them that believe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10. The believing ſoul when he views the treaſures of grace, comfort and glory made over to him by Chriſt's will, cannot but admire the incomparableneſs of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and although the believers eſtimate of Chriſt be ſo ingenuous as to prize Chriſt for his own worth, yet it cannot be unthankful, or not prize him for his gifts beſtowed on us. Whenever thou art going to a Sacrament (if other more quickening motives do not offer themſelves) think on that which Chriſt hath given thee by will; and conſider how glorious and excellent a perſon he is! who bequeathed theſe great and good things; and who can, and will beſtow every one of them upon thee.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Read over the will of Chriſt, and ponder well what he hath given and bequeathed, then reflect upon thy ſelf and ſee what thou art now, what thou waſt when he gave, and what thou art like to be ſo long as thou liveſt upon earth.</hi> And when this is well conſidered, thou wilt

                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Gave theſe great things of</hi> pardon and life; of grace and holineſs; of peace and comfort; of victory and glory; (contained in his Legacies) <hi>to ſtrangers, diſeſteemers, rejecters;</hi> and in a word, <hi>enemies of the giver and the gifts.</hi> Now 'tis a generous mind which will do good to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, forlorn men and women who knew not their miſery, who undervalued their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, who rejected the motion, who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their enmity againſt their deliverer.

                           <p>Our Lord noteth in the parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.30. That a man went down from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (a Jew) whom thieves robbed, and left wounded and half dead, inſenſible of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and unable to ask for help,
<note place="margin">The enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi> aroſe on occaſion of that Schiſm which the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> were guilty of, and maintained againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning the Worſhip of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.20. <hi>Our Fathers worſhipped in this Mountain, and ye ſay that in Jeruſalem is the place,</hi> &amp;c. This quarrel began ſoon after the Captivity of the Ten Tribes by <hi>Salmaneſar</hi> 700 years before Chriſt was born, and it had been countenanced by a High Prieſt and a Temple in a continued Succeſſion of 300 years, and ſomewhat more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the birth of Chriſt: So old was this enmity.</note> whom a <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan</hi> pittied, <hi>ver.</hi> 33.

                           <p>But this generous compaſſion of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan</hi> checks the old quarrel, and lendeth a helping hand; ſuch noble compaſſion is the compaſſion of our Lord to us, to whom <hi>God commendeth his love, that when we were enemies Chriſt dyed for us, Rom.</hi> 5.8. However diſingenious ſinners ſlight and undervalue the perſon of Chriſt, and his love toward them, whileſt they were very enemies, yet whenſoever grace appeath, it changeth their minds, and maketh ſinners ceaſe from ſin, and become Saints; they ſhall at once both admire the excellency of Chriſt's perſon and love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and comdemn all their former low, &amp; unbeſeeming apprehenſions of Chriſt &amp; his love. As the compaſſion of Chriſt was thus generous in pittying of an undone enemy.</p>
                           <p n="2">2.

Behold here is love as the Apoſtle hath it 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. Not <hi>that we loved God, but he loved us,</hi> &amp;c. here love is Triumphant indeed!

                           <p n="1">1. The candour and humanity which we ſhew to every man who is dead, of whom either nothing ought be ſaid, or nothing but good; an ingenuous perſon is moved with Zeal for the name and credit of the dead, when they are traduced, eſpecially</p>
                           <p n="2">2. When the innocency of the perſon was in his whole life well known to all who in any degree of acquaintance knew him we ſhould not take up the buried miſcarriages of of the dead, nor may we diſguiſe the good workes of thoſe that are not by to plead for themſelves.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. When our Friends were uſeful to all that needed and would make uſe of them, we endure not they ſhould be traduced by ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rancor and envy.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. When all this Friendſhip, innocency uſefulneſs, and generous beneficence of our Friend met with nothing almoſt but cauſeleſs vexations and troubles, and of theſe one ſucceeding the other without Reſt: we think it hard (as indeed it is very exceeding hard) meaſure, that it neither meet with reſt in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44263:91"/>life, nor death that it ſhould be defamed where all men have a priviledg ſecuring them from piercing cenſures, and envious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: theſe and ſuch like motives of Zeal for the honour of our dear Friend who Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from us left his love to live with us, are equally applicable to any ſuch Friend, if any ſuch may be found among the ſons of men. But over and above all theſe in cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there are ſome ſpecial incentives to Zeal for the honour of our Lord on this very account, that he dyed a Teſtator making his Teſtament and laſt Will.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby we are embodied into the family whereof Chriſt is the head and cheif;</hi> ſo that our zeal for his honour, is a zeal for the honour of our whole family. That we are of his family, is a very high ennobling us, a very great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching us, it doth exceedingly enhance our worth &amp; honour, &amp; we therefore are highly obliged to contend for his honour; we rightly judge the ſon bound to plead the honour of his dying Father, and we do as rightly judge the Chriſtian much more bound to plead the honour of his dying Lord, whoſe Teſtament hath made him a Son, and gave him a ſhare both in the honour and wealth of the family.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>In the laſt Will of our Dying Lord we read his Zeal and ſtrength of affection for our peace, our comfort, our ſafety, and our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> all which falleth to the ground and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth: if the Legacies of our Lord fail us, we had need therefore with Zeal contend for his honour; not as though our plea would in any thing ratify, or confirm, for (as we cannot give) ſo neither needs he to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive

But yet (after the manner of men be it ſpoken) we are bound to aſſert and defend the glory of his authority and power of diſpoſing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing to us, and to others, whatſoever he hath by Will and Teſtamentary diſpoſition left to us and to them. If he had given what was not his to give, we muſt either ſoon have parted with it, or for ever have miſſed of it; but herein lieth our advantage and comfort, that the large Legacies of our Lord to us, are as the fruit of ſo much Zealous love for us; ſo they are the Acts of Soveraign power delegated to Chriſt by the Father, as our Lord himſelf intimateth to us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.29. <hi>As the Father hath appointed unto me, ſo I appoint a Kingdom unto you.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our Zeal then for the honour of Chriſt doth as well maintain our hope, comfort and intereſs, as it doth maintain his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and what man would ſuffer the power to be nulled which gave him a rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Legacy?</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>The least degree of good bequeathed to us by the Will of our Testator in his will</hi> (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by us in the Lords ſupper) <hi>doth greatly ſurpaſs all the Zeal we can bear to his glory and honour:</hi> read over his will, and ſee there is juſtification in his blood ſhed for remiſſion of ſin, aſſurance of peace with God ſecured by the frequent remembrance of the blood of ſprinkling, Sanctification, conſolation, and future glory; all theſe promiſed by him, who being Mediator of the Covenant, hath redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the whole to the form of a Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44263:92"/>diſpoſition, and confirmed it by his death. Now when thou art going to a Sacrament, conſider and judge with thy ſelf, ſhould I not be very Zealous for his honour who hath given many ineſtimable gifts to me? am I not leſs than the leaſt of grace bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed? is not remiſſion of my ſin greater love than my love can requite? is not Hope of glory greater than mine obedience can ever equall? ſhall I then ever think I have affection enough? or have done enough for his honour by whom I have received what I have already, by whom I ſhall receive what I hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? No! No! I muſt be ever blowing my love into a greater flame of Zeal for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and yet his love and Zeal for me will outſhine and overpower all mine for him.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>View the Will of thy Teſtator, be perſwaded to remember that he is now living in glory, and beholdeth all that Love and Zeal which thou carriest in thy breaſt,</hi> which thou expreſſeſt in thy life toward him: he is not like other men, who dying, know no more of the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and behaviour of befriended ſurvivours: thou canſt not bury the knowledge (for duſt hath not blinded the eye) of the Lord; he lives for ever, and he knows how thou recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, improveſt and reſenteſt his Love and Zeal for thy good, and with what face wilt thou appear before him one day if thou haſt not been hired (ſhall I ſay?) or bought with ſo great price into the love of, and into a Zeal for thy beneficent, liberal and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Friend and Lord?

I do not ſay the heart is unfit for it who doth not rejoice; I know the ſpiritual hunger and thirſt of the ſoul ſpeaketh the ſoul fit, and ſuch may, ſuch indeed ought to come; yet when hunger and thirſt after the Lord are accompanied with joy in the Lord,

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44263:94"/>they not better worth your delight than all the worldling can delight in; how much do ſpiritual mercies excel temporal? how far do Heavenly priviledges excel earthly? ſo much certainly may the joy of believers in their Lord, excel the joy of carnal men; for whileſt the common bounty of a Dying Lord gives ſenſible, outward, and temporal good to mankind, the ſpecial grace and love of their Dying Lord and Saviour, giveth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers all ſpiritual mercies in heavenly things.

                           <p n="1">1. Other goods are preſent under a Law of mutability and change to the worſe, theſe ſhall only change to the better.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Other goods are poſſeſſed with anxious cares leſt they ſhould, and with tormenting fears that they will fail us at our need. But the Legacies our Lord hath given are poſſeſſed with aſſurance that they ſhall beſt beſtead us when we moſt need them.</p>

                           <p>Thou then who ſeeſt thy Lord's bounty, and who taſteſt the ſweetneſs of the preſent poſſeſſed goods, (with theſe advantages over and above all the enjoyments of the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,) enjoyn thy ſelf to rejoice more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in that thou doſt ſo much enjoy; it is warrantable thou ſhouldſt excell them in thy affection whom thou excelleſt in thy poſſeſſion.</p>

'Twere ſtrange if the generality of Chriſtians ſhould miſtake in a practical point of ſuch daily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44263:96"/>for herein we ſhew forth his death until he come.

                           <p n="1">1. <hi>Look, ſee what he hath as a Teſtator done for you and me. He hath bequeathed to us a participation with himſelf in every excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing we needed, or are capable of.</hi> He hath conveyed to us by his laſt will, pardon and juſtification through his Death, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

In one word, the whole Covenant of grace framed into a Teſtament, is confirmed by the Death of Chriſt the Teſtatour; ſo that <hi>thou, and I, are beholding to Chriſt a Teſtator for all the riches of grace, conſolation and glory.</hi> Well worthy of thine and my praiſe, thanks, and hearty acknowledgments is Chriſt therefore for that he by his Death hath procured, and by will hath entitled us unto ſuch great and glorious advantages and benefits.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt a Teſtator hath deſerved thy moſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44263:96"/>grateful reſentments of his love for that he hath by this means removed all thy fears, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all thy doubts, leaſt at any time thou ſhouldſt</hi> (by reaſon of thy weak faith and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective love,) <hi>fall ſhort of the goodneſs and bleſſings thou expecteſt;</hi> for this (as other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments) is of force now that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is dead, and ſince he is dead none may either null it, or alter it, but it muſt continue for ever in ſtrength.

Now what ever doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the excellency of the promiſes made to us, doth likewiſe advance our debt of thankfulneſs for the promiſes.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Teſtator</hi> is <hi>worthy of our highest Gratitude, for</hi> ſo much as <hi>he hath by his last Will and Testament diſpoſed of his rich inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance amongst us, ſo as we may duly expect, and constantly fetch in as much as we will of grace for our preſent help and comfort, reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fullneſs of all unto the final conſummation of the elect redeemed.</hi> Many a man loſeth all, or elſe much of his thankes by an unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable caution in his will, that the Legatees ſhall have nothing of the gift until ſuch a time to which it is uncertain whether he live; but Chriſt deſerveth our admiration, as well as our thanks, for the preſent benefit, uſe, and advantages we have from his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He hath ſo given, that wee may now enjoy; we ſo enjoy now, that hereafter we ſhall receive; <hi>preſent enjoyments</hi> were <hi>not to be compared with future;</hi> the preſent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44263:97"/>is ſufficient to keep us handſomely; the future is far above mine and your thoughts.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt a Testator worthy of thy thanks</hi> for ſo much as <hi>he was thus mindful of thee at the laſt, when enemies inſulted and vaunted againſt him;</hi> when ſorrows and pains did ſeiſe him; when his Friends ſtood aloof off, and ſome of them denied him; when many were content not to be known of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance; when he foreſaw what Friends we (in our ſeveral generations) would be to him; for what theſe perſons were under Chriſt's Eye, was both an index, or diſcovery of them, and alſo a ſymptome, or prognoſtick what we after them would prove. And yet for all this his love continued firm to us, and made them and us Heirs both of his own, and of his Father's love alſo.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. And laſtly, conſider this, <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, is Chriſt Voluntarily Dying that he might make all ſure to us.</hi> He was not by nature under an unchangeable law of Death, as we are; if he had not loved us ſo much, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to have Died; here then is his plea and Title unto our Gratitude; he did Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and of choice put himſelf into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he might dye, to procure and confirm the promiſes to us. And yet the kind and manner of Dying, and pains he did foreſee in his Death, are the circumſtances which, as they ſet off, and advance his love to us, ſo do they increaſe and augment our debt of a loving hearty reſentment of his kindneſs. Sirs, Chriſt muſt dye a curſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vindictive juſtice of God ere he
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44263:97"/>could convey by will the Heavenly, bleſſed and everlaſting Legacies, which we now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him as a Teſtator. Whoſo ſhall caſt an Eye upon theſe particulars, if others more quickning do not occur, yet theſe will either perſwade to thankfulneſs, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unthankfulneſs inexcuſable. We do uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pick out ſuch circumſtances as theſe to commend the worthineſs of our Friends love towards us at his Death; he remembred me in what I moſt needed, provided for me as much as I need, or can receive, he (I thank him) ſetled it by will that I might be ſure of it: And <hi>herein I am greatlieſt beholden to him, that as I was unfit to be truſted with all at once, and unable to ſubſiſt without any of it for preſent, he did in wiſe kindneſs to me provide that the main part ſhould be reſerved for me, and that the leſſer be now given unto me.</hi> So Chriſt, that I might live, and rejoice in the preſent grace of my Lord to me; that I might be rich and happy in the poſſeſſion of the whole, when I was fit for, and capable of it, did wiſely bequeath me a portion of peace in him, grace from him, comfort through him, all which I needed, but hath reſerved, fulneſs of Glory, the immarceſcible Crown, the unchangeable Kingdom, the inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unſpeakable bleſſedneſs, until I ſhould be prepared to enjoy them all: herein the love of Chriſt excelleth, inſomuch as he did all this for us, when ſorrows and troubles, greater than can be equalled were beſetting him; nay, he put himſelf into a ſtate ſubject to all thoſe ſorrows and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles (from which by nature he was free)
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44263:98"/>that he might be liable to dye, and make all this mercy ſure to thee, and me (and ſuch like us) by Teſtament: and thou, and I muſt thank him that he did it for us who by our folly and wickedneſs were the cauſes of all this ſorrow, and trouble to him. Here is love to be owned with higheſt renſentments, and moſt enlarged affections; <hi>Chriſt is the greateſt conquerour of hearts and therefore to be crowned with a triumphant wreath of enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hearts;</hi> oh live, and dye in the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments of his love. If (as ſome men will have it) his Table where thou ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt with him be an Altar, let not this Altar ever want a flaming Sacrifice. <hi>Let thine heart be offered to him; he deſerveth more, thou canſt not tender leſs; it were too little if thou had'ſt ought more; it will be ſufficient if thou doſt not think it too much.</hi> Oh my ſoul! thy preſent income is worth thy thanks; thy future full poſſeſſion is fitteſt for an eſtimate and thanks in the higheſt Heavens.</p>

                           <p n="1">1. <hi>The Apoſtles motive to humility,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>offereth it ſelf to us in the very entrance on this meditation; what haſt thou which thou haſt not received?</hi> look on either the beauty of thy renewed ſoul, or the comelineſs of thy holy converſation, or the excellency of thy juſtified ſtate, or the honour of thy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, or look on the luſtre of thy ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual joyes, thy heavenly Hopes. And of all theſe in general, or of any of the particulars compriſed in them; can'ſt thou ſay, this, or that is not received? I know thou can'ſt not deny the receiving, and if thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, why doſt thou boaſt? this Queſtion, like a needle, opens the ſwoln bladder of pride, and letteth out the wind of vain opinion, which would either corrupt, or break us.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44263:99"/>Thou hadſt had as little to pride thy ſelf in as one who hath only his ſhame to glory in, if thou hadſt not received what is now thy glory; it was the bounty of thy Rich, and Loving, Friend at his Death, to enrich thee; thou haſt no reaſon either</p>
                           <p n="1">1. To boaſt before God, who hath choſen and called thee, as others like thee, weak, fooliſh and baſe; Free and Rich mercy hath raiſed, made wiſe, and excellent; and now neither thou, I, or any fleſh may boaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>For what we are, we are in Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 30. And the glory is due to God alone; as <hi>v.</hi> 31.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Nor to boaſt over thy brother who was every whit as Good as thou before Grace made the difference, and may ere long be as Rich in Grace as any, and more humble than thou art yet. He who hath adorned and bleſſed thee, might with the ſame freeneſs have adorned him whom thou deſpiſeſt. Since then all that Good which is in thee was given to thee by thy Dying Lord, it is abſurd and exceeding unſeemly for thee to lift up thy ſelf above thy brother, or to Glory in thy ſelf before thy God. When thou intendeſt to approach the Sacrament, and when thou art there attending on the Lord, remember thou hadſt been poor and deſtitute of all thoſe bleſſings therein repreſented, if thy Lord Dying, had not by Will bequeathed all to thee;</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>The Second perſwaſive to Humility</hi> drawn from the Death of Chriſt as a Teſtator, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us ſuch Legacies, may be <hi>our incapacity to ſerve him in any real ſervice of advantage to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44263:99"/>him.</hi> We Never yet were, we never ſhall hereafter be in any capacity either of deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what we have received, or of requiting the love which gave it to us.

Our Lord nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it not; <hi>wee are, when our beſt is done, unprofitable ſervants.</hi> Theſe are two things which have kept better men in a humble, lowly thought of themſelves. <hi>David</hi>'s prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.1. was from a humble heart, and in an humbled ſtate; and he maintained his Humility on the obſervation of his uſeleſneſs and unprofitableneſs to his Lord, his preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>My Goodneſs extendeth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee,</hi> &amp;c.

Job.</hi> 22.2. lay's down man's unprofitableneſs firſt, and leaves us to conclude that <hi>unprofitable man muſt be a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man;</hi> thou mayeſt not be proud before one who needs thee not; thou muſt not boaſt in thy Beſt, ſeeing thy beſt is not good to him before whom thou boaſteſt. Should a man boaſt himſelf in his ſmoaky cottage before his Soveraign in his magnificent pallace? or ſhould a lame and decrepit fool boaſt of his wiſdom and ſtrength, and commend it to his Soveraign for the wars? In a word or two,</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Were thy Lord but a man, yet his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of Majeſty and certaineſt coming in Glory confirmed, repreſented to thee in his Laſt Teſtament, mindeth thee that he needeth not thy help. Thou canſt not ſay, He can
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44263:100"/>be, but not ſo well without me.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The largeneſs of that ſtate he was poſſeſſed of before he gave thee intereſs in it, and which he hath ſtill in his poſſeſſion ſince he gave thee a right to any part of it, doth clearly demonſtrate that thou haſt nothing to pride thy ſelf in before thy Teſtator: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other cauſes of humility, we ſhall find that the wealth and Riches of thoſe we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before, is one which perſwadeth us to a demiſs and lowly deportment and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; there is an appearance of Glory in Riches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.16. For with increaſe of Riches there is in common eſteem an increaſe of Glory. Now in the gifts and Legacies of thy Dying Lord, thou mayſt clearely ſee thoſe true, precious, and laſting Treaſures of grace, comfort and glory, which he was, and is ſtill owner of; <hi>with him are Riches and honour, Prov.</hi> 8.18. To him therefore reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent carriage, and humble thoughts, (affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and eſteem) of our ſelves in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is moſt ſuitable. And who is not affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with humility and lowlineſs toward Chriſt, is ſo much the more injurious to him by how much more excellent and precious Chriſt's riches and wealth excel the Riches of men which are ſo highly eſteemed, that they are judged ſufficient ground of honour to the owner, and ſufficient cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding humble carriage in the poorer.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>In Chriſt Dying a Teſtator,</hi> thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſcern a <hi>dignity of dominion and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip over the things which are diſpoſed of by will;</hi> A dominion which cometh near to an abſolute and uncontrouled dominion, what a
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:44263:100"/>man may give by will to whomſoever he pleaſeth, is more under the dominion of that man than the things which need a farther and more large conveyance. As the eſtate which may be deviſed by Will, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to a Child, Friend, or ſtranger, is more under the dominion of the preſent owner, than is that eſtate which ſome law entaileth on the owners heirs, or Children. Now this being the caſe. Chriſt's dominion, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſoveraignty over the good things he hath given by Will, doth require and deſerve a humble and lowly ſpirit in thoſe who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of theſe gifts. Dominion is as a Ground of honour in thoſe who are inveſted with it; ſo a Ground of humility in thoſe who are inferiour to it. What would be eſteemed Friendly familiarity in me towards my equal, and a commendable deportment, would be accounted inſolent pride in me towards my Lord, or Soveraigne, and a carriage not to be endured. <hi>Joſeph</hi> advanced to be Ruler over all the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> muſt be ſaluted with a Bowing Knee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.43.

<note place="margin">Gen. 27.29. Iſa. 49.23. Eſth. 3.2, 5.</note> (1.) of his worth and honour, (2.) of the meanneſs and lowneſs of the reſt who bowed. It is a very general and ancient ſigne of the reſpect we bear to the dignity and worth of any one we bow before. The inſolent ſouldiers in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage toward Chriſt when they bowed the knee, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.29. Shewed us what humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity becometh ſubjects, and what honour is due to Soveraigns. Look then on that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dominion and power which appeareth in

He is by a ſacred right Lord of our life, and when he biddeth us venture it in hazards, or lay it down in unavoidable death for him, we muſt do it: His love ought thus to conſtrain us.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44263:102"/>and reſolve to ſuffer for him thou Loveſt.

Think then as the Love of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Friend ſhould make thee reſolute in Suffering; ſo the preſent advantage and reward will warrant thee to deſire opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Suffering for him, if he ſhall ſee good ſo to try thee.

Well then, ſo often as thou goeſt to the Sacrament, thou reneweſt the memory of thy Lord, whoſe Love deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thou ſhouldeſt patiently bear; whoſe reward when leaſt, will ſurpaſs thy ſufferings when they are greateſt; who will meaſure out to thee a reward proportioned to thy ſufferings; who lives to ſee and obſerve all thou ſuffereſt: thy Captain Generals Eye is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44263:105"/>upon thee, and will not this perſwade to reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of bearing, and conſtant patience in bearing for Chriſt? theſe among other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to a Chriſtian fortitude in ſuffering for Chriſt, may be drawn from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Dying a Teſtator, and a larger improvement of them I commend to your private meditations.

THE <hi>tenth Sacramental grace</hi> I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as befitting us at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, was <hi>Sorrow for doing ſo little for him, with grief that we have done ſo much againſt him.</hi> This temper of mind is highly improveable by pondering what Chriſt hath as a Teſtator done for us. I know there are many other motives to Repentance which may be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably thought on at the Sacrament: there are alſo in this ſufficient inducements to that Godly ſorrow which becometh the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of our Dying Lord, and loving Friend.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Firſt <hi>the Chriſtian as he is a man, as he is principled and ſwayed with the affections of Humane Nature, cannot but reflect with greif
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44263:105"/>upon his carriages and deportment towards a Friend who loved him intirely, who was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with the diſingenuous returnes of ſcorn; neglect, and hatred.</hi> When we have unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, or unwittingly ſleighted any Friend we dearly loved, or ſhould have loved, we cannot remember it without ſhame, ſorrow, confeſſing, praying pardon, and excuſe, with promiſe to be more heedful, more reſpectful for future. There is no love ſo tender and apt to diſtil into tears, as that which is won by a worthy, excellent, perſon conquering ungrounded prejudices, unreaſonable neglects, and unjuſtifiable contempts; ſuch affronted love, when it prevails at laſt, doth kindle the ſtrongeſt fires, and heapeth up the coals which melt the hardeſt, and moſt ſtubborn metal. Many a hard heart hath by ſuch flame been melted down to tenderneſs; <hi>Saul</hi> grew warm by it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17, 18, 19. And in the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.21. It breaketh out into a flame of affection toward <hi>David,</hi> and againſt himſelf, for his unreaſonable uſages toward <hi>David. Saul</hi> accuſeth himſelf, but acquitteth <hi>David;</hi> he confeſſeth his ſin, his folly and great errour in deſigning evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one who did ſo well deſerve his love. Though <hi>Saul</hi> were diſingenuous (more than enough) againſt his Son <hi>David,</hi> yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of his thoughts on <hi>David</hi>'s kindneſs, drew him into tears, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. Wilt thou be more diſingenuous to thy Lord than <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David?</hi> how long didſt thou directly oppoſe, bitterly hate, ſcornfully reproach, and unreaſonably reaſon againſt Chriſt's Law, ordinances, waies and followers? what kind
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44263:106"/>of life didſt thou in the days of unregeneracy live? if thou waſt not a violent perſecutor, yet thou didſt long think hardly of Chriſt and the Goſpel, yet then Chriſt did not cut thee off, nor leave thee to periſh in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſalvation; wilt thou not ſay thou haſt erred greatly? done fooliſhly? and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? canſt thou do leſs than weep over the thoughts hereof? In the Sacrament thou commemorateſt the moſt unparalleld love, and beneficence, triumphing over unkindneſs, and unthankfulneſs, a Teſtator bequeathing grace, comfort, glory and ſalvation to thee, and others like thee who undervalued, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, hated, and perſecuted him. Canſt thou remember this and not grieve? canſt thou review it and not be diſpleaſed with thy ſelf? and condemn thy folly?</p>

Either thou art not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with what Chriſt hath done for thee in his laſt Will and Teſtament; or thou haſt not yet obſerved how little love, ſervice, and honour thou haſt returned him for his love; or if thou knoweſt, and obſerveſt both theſe, they work in thee a readineſs of mind to correct thine errours, a defence for Chriſt, and blame of thy ſelf with indignation againſt thy former folly; fear of being ſo fooliſh any more, earneſt deſire (to be one with Chriſt) and Zeal for his glory, with revenge on thy ſins which eclipſed it.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44263:111"/>our greateſt obedience; Legacies no way to be attained but in the ſincere obedience of our life and heart: Legacies that ſhall be given by him who is now living to ſee who obeys him, as he once died to enſure the reward to their obedience; Legacies that muſt be adjudg'd to the obedient by him who commands the obedience, and made the Will; out of all which reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</p>
                           <p n="1">1. A Motive that may prevail with our ingenuity and hopes; we obey in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Noble Reward; our Legacies are worth better obedience.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. A Motive that may work on, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with our fears, and our leſs ingenuous principles: Our Judge his eye is on us; and he is our Judge who will give only to the obedient.</p>

                              <hi>THE Twelfth and laſt Grace mentioned,</hi> cap. 4. ſect. 12. as a Sacramental Grace well ſuiting with the Lord's Supper, that Feaſt of Love, and improveable by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Chriſt's dying a Teſtator, <hi>is Brotherly Kindneſs and Charity; a peaceable diſpoſition of mind towards our Chriſtian friends, and a loving affection for our Brethren in Chriſt.</hi> This grace is ſo needful, that none are ſo ignorant as to doubt, none ſo prophane as to deny it, a needful qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet whilſt ignorance and prophaneneſs, confeſs it in words, they are both far from the true exerciſe hereof. The conſiderate, meditating and diſcerning communicant, will be careful to provide this grace for this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to improve it by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which may very well be done by ſuch conſiderations as theſe.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>Our Chriſtian Brethren whom we ſhould love, are made truly lovely by the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which Chriſt hath bequeathed to them, and which he hath in ſome part already beſtowed upon them.</hi> For Chriſt the great, bountiful and wiſe Teſtator, hath, as is already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, ſo diſpoſed his eſtate and treaſures of grace, conſolation and glory, with other
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44263:112"/>advantages, and needful ſupplies, that all his friends ſhould be handſomly maintained out of his Treaſury, although the principal of the eſtate be reſerved in Heaven to enrich them there. As <hi>Rebeccah</hi> was adorned with rich Jewels before ſhe was brought to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who inveſted her with all when ſhe came to him, and the marriage was conſummate. So the Church, (ſo each particular Believer) is adorned with very rich Jewels of grace, gifts and comforts, in which ſhe is brought to Chriſt, who will inveſt all on her when he ſhall conſummate the Marriage in Glory. The Crown it is true is reſerved for the future ſtate of Glory; but there are many ſingle Jewels already beſtowed. <hi>The King's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious within, Pſal.</hi> 45. The Saints of God, the Righteous ones are the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent on earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.3. They are filled with the Spirit of Chriſt; and they are led by that Spirit into all the waies of Truth, Holineſs, Meekneſs, Goodneſs, Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, and the like. The Philopher tells us, that true Friendſhip is only among the true vertuous. <hi>Vice cannot be a cement of Friendſhip.</hi> In the Redeemed, Called, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, there is what fitteth them for, and renders them worthy of our love and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affections.</p>
                           <p>Two things do ordinarily prevail with men to excite Natural love; firſt, the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpoſition, a skill and delight to ſhew our ſelves friendly, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.24. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much beloved, who is not ready and prone to love. Secondly, the largeneſs of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44263:112"/>eſtate and wealth; it is the <hi>Rich man that hath many friends, Prov.</hi> 14.20. Both theſe, Motives to love, the Believer ſeeth in every Believer. Grace doth very much ſweeten Nature, and Grace doth very much enrich the perſon. Theſe Motives of love may be found in every Legatee, who hath ſhare in the choice Legacies of Chriſt; he giveth an excellency of ſpirit which ſweetneth their diſpoſition; they are meek, lowly, faithful, and without guile: He alſo giveth an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, a heavenly, a glorious Inheritance; theſe win with the conſiderate Chriſtian; and either thou knoweſt not what Chriſt hath beſtowed on Believers, or thou muſt confeſs they are well worthy of thy love, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Inducement to Brotherly Love contained in this conſideration of Chriſt Dying a Teſtator, may be this: Every Believer having intereſs in this Will, was near to Chriſt's heart, as art thou, or I, or any other who pretendeth title and intereſs in Chriſt's Last Teſtament.</hi> Now, ſhould it not move us to love with hearty love every Chriſtian, for ſo much as every one of them was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near to the hearty love of Chriſt? Let our hearts be toward them,
<note place="margin">Joh. 15.12.</note> as Chriſt's was toward us and them. It is a maxim in Love and Friendſhip, that it extend it ſelf to all our friends friends. Hence the advice of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> that <hi>thy Father's friend be not forſaken,
<note place="margin">Prov. 27.10</note> carries ſound reaſon in it;</hi> for he that is the Father's friend, and heartily loved him that begot, will be a friend to the Son, and love
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:44263:113"/>him that was begotten too; as the Apoſtle argueth in a like caſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle urgeth this Love of Chriſt to us as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to perſwade us to love one another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.5. with <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. to be of the ſame mind,
<note place="margin">

                              </note> that ſo ye may live in Peace and Love, which is the fruit of that Union the Apoſtle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us to, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2. where he explaineth (<gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one mind, by, (<gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>) having the ſame Love. The Love we ſhould have for the Brethren (of right) ſhould be ſo ſtrong as death, becauſe that Love which Chriſt had for them equally and indifferently, was even unto death. This is the Apoſtle's Argument, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. And there is ſtrength in it, whether we apprehend it or no. In the laſt Will of Chriſt thou mayeſt diſcern a Love equally embracing all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſeek their portion in Chriſt. There we may find Chriſt a friend to the poor, as to the rich Believer; to the unlearned, as to the learned Believer; to the deſpiſed, as to the honourable Believer. As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of Righteouſneſs, (I may ſpeak (and you muſt underſtand) of all) the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the Covenant and Teſtament: The whole is by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. Now where Chriſt hath made no difference in his Love, dareſt thou make ſo great a difference in thine, as to withhold thy love from ſome?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44263:113"/>Wilt thou not love thoſe who are dear friends to thy deareſt Lord? thy beſt friend? I do not preſs an equality of love to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. I know, our brethren by nature, our kindred by alliances, our acquaintance and intimate friends, have a right to our love and affections, both Natural and Civil, and where ſuch a Right is doubled by our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to each other in Chriſt, our affections may be allowed to double themſelves alſo. Whilſt Grace and common Hopes do increaſe our love to each other, they do allow for the reſpects which Nature calleth for of us. We muſt love all with an unfeigned love, though we may love ſome with a more fervent love: whom Chriſt hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually loved, we muſt unfeignedly love; and what reneweth the remembrance of ſuch love to us, ſhould renew our love to others.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>In the laſt Will of Chriſt is to be ſeen, That it is the expreſs deſire of our Dying Lord we ſhould love one another heartily and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly.</hi> He hath therefore put them all into one Will, and into the ſame capacity; every one by his Will made an heir. The Saints do inherit the Riches of Glory, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.18. Their title is a joint-tenancy;
<note place="margin">
                                 <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>.</note> they are coheirs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9. And this title is by gift of Chriſt in his laſt Teſtament, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. Who deſired they ſhould all be where he was, that they might behold his glory. And read we <hi>John</hi> 15.12. <hi>This is my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> This is that Commandment that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44263:114"/>is ſo mine, as if all others were to yield place to this. <hi>This is the New Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Joh.</hi> 13.34. and 35. When Chriſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Angels gave the Law to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Firſt Great Commandment was, <hi>Love the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. The Second was, <hi>Love thy Neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. When he was to die he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the Commandment of loving our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Yea, ſo reſolvedly doth our Lord require this Brotherly Love, that whoſoever he is pretends to Chriſt, muſt make good his pretenſions to Chriſt by his affections to all that are Brethren in Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.35. <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if ye have love for one another.</hi> Add hereto 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.20. He loves not God who loveth not the Children of God. For how ſhall he love God whom he hath not ſeen, who loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen? In a word, read the laſt words of Chriſt's Interceſſion, <hi>John</hi> 17.26. which do breathe out the earneſt deſire of Chriſt, that ſuch love may be among the Brethren one to another, as was in the Father and in the Son to them all. Now after all this vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of deſire in Chriſt that we who are heirs by his Will, ſhould love one another. Shall any of us dare to hate, undervalue, reject, or deſpiſe the other? Will you read the laſt Teſtament of Love with a heart of enmity? Dare you come to the Ordinance which renews the remembrance of Chriſt's Love to us, of his deſire we ſhould love each other, and not labour to renew your love to them? Renewed meditations on
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44263:114"/>Chriſt's love to us will certainly renew our love to him and to all his; renewed thoughts of his laſt deſire, of his earneſt commending mutual love, will renew mutuall love in us if any degree of ingenuity remain in us.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. <hi>In the Teſtament and Laſt Will of our Dying Lord we have this inducement to renew our love to the Brethren. He hath by will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned one onely place in which with moſt perfect love to enjoy as all the bleſſed Legacies of our Lord, ſo to enjoy all our fellow Legatees.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall perſwade now I know not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my arguings be powerful enough to ſuppreſs envyings, and jealouſies, to remove animoſities, and quarrels from amongſt ſaints, I cannot tell. But this I know, and this I will tell you, when you who are now enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to the Legacies of this great Teſtator ſhall every one of you meet together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the full and total of what you can receive, and Chriſt will give; there ſhall need no ſuch arguments, no ſuch reaſonings, no ſuch intreaties to perſwade you to Mutual Love. There you ſhall not chuſe but Love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, and embrace each other. Come then think what you ſhall be when you Feaſt all together at your Lord's Table in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And judge with your ſelves is it nor meet we ſhould be ſuch now? It will be then a part of your Glory. And is not your mind and judgment convinced that it is the Glory of a Chriſtian to ſtrive to be now what he ſhall be hereafter? Chriſt will bring the Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred ſheep of his flock into one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.52. When there ſhall remain on foot-ſteps of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44263:115"/>their former folly and diſcord. It is a high expreſſion which the holy ghoſt uſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. And I will now forbear to ſearch in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. <hi>Holy Father keep through thine own name thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one as we are.</hi> It is a place which enſureth us that ſuch who by the Father are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the future ſtate of the Saints in Heaven, are kept to a moſt intimate and Glorious Union, Friendſhip and Love. Now they who will not be perſwaded to cement, to unite affections, to love one another here, how highly do they croſs the deſigne of Chriſt and of the Father? Oh that I could perſwade all who hear or read my words, and oh that more lively ſenſe of what I write were upon mine own heart! Lord I read thy Will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22. <hi>The Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given unto them that they may be one even as we are one.</hi> Oh let the Remembrance of thy deſigne of our future Union renewed in the Memorial of thy laſt Will at each Sacrament, cauſe me and all believers, to ſtudy and endeavour a preſent Union and Brotherly love more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming our future bleſſed Union and love. It may be I ſhall be quarrelled at for this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of gaining love from thoſe that yet love me not, &amp; poſſibly loſe what I thought to keep the love of ſome that have embraced me with a more Brotherly affection than hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they will, this may poſſibly be the Fruit of their paſſions, and the unhappineſs of my weak, and imperfect diſcourſes. But I ſhall retire my ſelf from ſuch ſtorms, and view the bleſſed Legacies my dying Lord hath bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44263:115"/>me, peace he hath left for me his peace he hath given unto me. And with his Peace, his Love, I ſhall at laſt I Hope Love them for ever who now will ſcarce give me leave ſo to do; they ſhall love me who think they never will. What my words cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſs, what my explanations cannot yet make clear, that day of glorious appearing of our bleſſed Teſtator to give us the full poſſeſſion of all bequeathed bleſſings ſhall reveale to us and we ſhall underſtand, <hi>All of grace in its Beginnings, Improvements, Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Crowning in Glory, to have been the free Gift of this great Teſtator dying far us.</hi>

                  <p>Sect. 2. <hi>Which Term cometh next to be ſomewhat explained.</hi> And here I conceive are <hi>two things</hi> ever found <hi>in a Curſe,</hi> according to the ſentence of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt, It either implieth an
<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 26.28. Ezek. 17.13 Gen. 49.7.</note> imprecation of evil in caſe of a perſidious violation of our Faith,</hi> (as in Covenants between equals) <hi>or a
<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 24.21. Deut. 29.14 Dan. 9.11</note> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of puniſhment from the Law of our Superiour in caſe of our perſidious refuſal or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Covenant we were under by his juſt ordination;</hi> by doing either of which the offender deſerveth and draweth down the Curſe by his falſifying, or breaking with God when he was under a Covenant of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or Law of righteouſneſs, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of reward and bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly, A curſe implieth all that evil
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44263:118"/>of ſorrow and ſuffering which is caſt upon the guilty by the avenging wrath of a contemned and provoked God vindicating the honour of himſelf and his Law, by executing the fierceneſs of his diſpleaſure on the falſifier of his juſt and holy Covenant.</hi> So when God threatned to curſe the perfidious people the Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.5. he firſt declares their ſin, <hi>They had broken the Everlaſting Covenant;</hi> they had dealt perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly therein, and diſhonoured God, who will therefore avenge the perjury by <hi>a Curſe that ſhall devour the earth, and lay deſolate thoſe that dwell in it, Iſa.</hi> 24.6. When God puniſht the moſt unhappy and laſt King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and his Princes with him, for their perfidious breaking oath, he did it by curſing them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 57.13. with 15. and 16. <hi>v. There is alwaies ſomewhat of Divine vengeance in the execution of a Curſe,</hi> and when God pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the ſentence with a Curſe, he executeth it in vindictive diſpleaſure. So <hi>Cain</hi> was judged. condemned and puniſhed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.11. So are the workers of iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. Sentenced to a Curſe, and it is executed on them by an eternal avenging Juſtice; and ſo was the Serpent condemned, <hi>Thou art curſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, all that puniſhmnnt which the violation of a Righteous Law deſerved, and the violated Law threatneth, and the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is capable of ſuffering, is compriſed in this one word Curſe; <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. From theſe things it in part appears what is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the third thing to be explained.</p>
                  <p>Sect. 3. <hi>What it is to be made, and how
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44263:118"/>Chriſt was made a Curſe.</hi> Now becauſe there is a vaſt difference between theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſinner's being made a Curſe; And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The bleſſed Jeſus made a Curſe. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak ſomewhat of each diſtinctly; ſo firſt ſinners are curſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Scelus patrando,</hi> by breaking the Law of God, which is the Covenant of Obedience, binding every rational creature to voluntary, conſtant and perfect performance of Duty. The Angels who kept not their firſt habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made themſelves accurſed thus, <hi>ſcelus patrando,</hi> falſifying in the Covenant of their Creatour. So did man at firſt unhappily caſt himſelf and his poſterity under a Curſe. The tranſgreſſing creature is, <hi>Faber ſuae miſeriae &amp; maledictionis,</hi> The framer or Architect of his own miſery. Now while ſinning creatures are, the ſinleſs Redeemer could never be, thus made a Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Lex maledicit poenam pecoanti minando, The Law accurſeth the ſinner, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning juſt puniſhment, determining what degree of puniſhment is juſt and proportioned to the crime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Apoſtle,
<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 3.10.</note> 
                     <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law are under a Curſe, i. e.</hi> as many as are found ſeeking to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the works of the Law, are by the Law convicted of tranſgreſſion, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in a Curſe which the Law threatens againſt all that are guilty; for by ſentence of this Law every one is curſed who continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them. In this ſenſe ſtrictly and properly Chriſt was not made a Curſe, for in this ſenſe the Curſe preſuppoſeth the perſon to have ſinned.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44263:119"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Puniendo maledicit vindex, The Judge maketh the offender accurſed, by inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the puniſhment deſerved through ſin, when he adjudgeth the tranſgreſſour to that miſery which the Law threatned, and his miſdeeds have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</hi> So God the juſt Judge of Heaven and Earth threatned a Curſe againſt the unhappy King of <hi>Judah, Ezek.</hi> 17.15, 16. So when he brings out the Curſe againſt the falſe ſwearers, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.3, 4. God makes him a Curſe by executing the ſentence of the Law upon him. They are curſed whom God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth in Hell, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.41. Now as this preſuppoſeth perſonal guilt, or ſin committed by him that is made a Curſe, it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould be applicable to Chriſt, The Holy One of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, <hi>The Actores, Teſtes, &amp; poenae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtri, The Impleaders, The Witneſſes and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of the penalty may in ſome ſenſe be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted among thoſe that make the offender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> Of all which I ſhall not ſpeak more at this time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, One may be made a Curſe, <hi>alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius reatum &amp; poenam ferendo, by bearing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's guilt and puniſhment;</hi> by a voluntary taking up anothers guilt, or fault, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the penalty thereof; ſo that the Law, Judge, and Impleaders in the proſecution lay the puniſhment on the Subſtitute who is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus inter Reos,</hi> or rather <hi>receptus pro reis,</hi> as the Lawyers, if I miſtake not their language, ſpeak. In the Prophet's words, <hi>Numbered with the tranſgreſſours;
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> Iſa. 53. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> ſo Chriſt did bear the ſin of many.</hi> Thus he was made a Curſe by his voluntary ſuſception of our guilt, and his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44263:119"/>ſubmiſſion to the penalty of our ſins. And in the tranſacting of this Chriſt was contented (which is that I apprehend peculiar to this Caſe) and which I promiſed to unfold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To be accounted, <hi>affinis culpae,</hi> to be ſent in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh: He had our ſins laid upon him; he did take them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; and ſo thoſe ſins which he could not either contrive, commit, or abet, he was willing ſhould be imputed to him. This in the Apoſtle's words is, <hi>He was made ſin for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Chriſt charged with our ſins was made a Curſe, by engaging himſelf to abide the ſentence of the Judge and Law menacing the ſins imputed.</hi> He that will for the good of another derive guilt on himſelf, muſt reſolve to abide by all the penal conſequences which a ſevere Law and an impartial Judge will inflict on him. Hence it is, I ſuppoſe, that the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>ult.</hi> hath ſo cloſely joined theſe two, <hi>He was numbred with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, and bore the ſins of many.</hi> The prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſory ſufferings from the juſt hand of God, who declareth his reſolution to vindicate his Law and Government; and who doth by Threats, Terrours and Griefs in part poured out on the guilty, partly execute his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and give them aſſurances he will farther proceed, (Theſe being but the beginnings of ſorrows) are a part of the Curſe iſſuing from the Law, and inflicted by one who hath power to fence his Law by them. Thus Chriſt expoſed himſelf to the ſad conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our imputed guilt, and being pleaſed to interrpoſe himſelf between us and the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44263:120"/>praevious penalties of our ſin, was made <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs; whilſt he did bear our griefs, and carry our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, Iſa.</hi> 53.3, 4. The oppreſſion and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice he did meet with from the world, was a fruit of that Curſe he was made for us. Theſe things did he ſuffer in life, whoſe love to us brought him to bear the Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt made a Curſe for us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth the exquiſite pains, and open ſhame of his Death for our ſin.</hi> It is death which is moſt legibly the execution of the Curſe of the Law on ſinners; and as then they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves accurſed indeed, when their own guilt hath in death overtaken them; ſo he that made himſelf a Curſe for them, found in his death on the Croſs the weight of that Curſe which he did bear for ſinners. Therefore do I ſuppoſe it was by Divine Providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the kind of death Chriſt did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, ſhould be in the ſentence of the Law an accurſed death, that we might more clearly diſcern the import of it, and ſee as our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by it, ſo our danger without this death of Chriſt; <hi>He was cut off from the land of the living, Iſa.</hi> 53.8. And when this was effected, it appeared that for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>greſſion of his people this ſtroke was upon him, as that verſe hath it. Though the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinner be alwaies under the ſmaller meaſures of a Curſe, yet when he dieth, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerveth, he dieth accurſed. The ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings our Lord Jeſus Chriſt underwent in his life, were likewiſe the ſcattering drops, But the black and violent ſhowre of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Curſe was poured down on him at his Death.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44263:120"/>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>Chriſt made a Curſe, and in death bearing it was to ſuffer under the ſtrokes of vindictive Juſtice pleading the cauſe, and vindicating the honour of the Law and Law-giver, which by the tranſgreſſions of ſinners had been contemned and violated.</hi> This, as hath been obſerved already, is one ingredient in the Curſe; and herein do chaſtlſements great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ from puniſhments ſtrictly taken; for in chaſtiſements there is no vindictive juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging the quarrel in order to ſatisfie Divine Juſtice, &amp; to attone the wrath of God; it is all in order to the humbling, melting, purifying us that we may ſeek and obtain mercy. But now when vindictive puniſhments ſtrictly taken are executed, it is in order to the cutting off, and deſtruction of the obdurate ſinners; they, as enemies, lying under the wrath of God and his curſe, which is moſt evident in the execution of the laſt unchangeable ſentence of Condemnation, paſt upon the impenitent, unbelieving, and ſelf-deſtroying world at the day of God's dreadful Judgment. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, Matth.</hi> 25.41. You do not, I hope, doubt whether it be the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>geance of an angry God which the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Hell ſuffer; and there is as little ground of doubt whether they ſuffer this vengeance in Hell to ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice; neither is it to be doubted but all they ſuffer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in that Curſe pronounced, <hi>Depart from me curſed.</hi> Now then, anſwerable to what hath been ſaid, as the condemned under their own deſerved Curſe ſuffer in order to ſatisfie Divine vindictive Juſtice for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44263:121"/>their own offences; ſo Chriſt made a Curſe, and bearing the Curſe for us, did bear it in order to make ſatisfaction for us, that we might obtain deliverance, and that avenging wrath might not fall on our heads ſince that we are no more under the Curſe deſerved by us, but under the Bleſſing procured for us by Chriſt. He trod the wine-preſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's wrath alone; his ſtripes were ſo ſmart and grievous, that by them we might be healed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. God did not ſpare him when he gave him up for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Let this then ſuffice for theſe particulars. <hi>In ſumme, To be made or bear the Curſe, is to ſtand charged with guilt, to be threatned with puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be cut off by the execution of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to the end Juſtice may be ſatisfied on the perſon who is made a Curſe.</hi> So that you may now ſee what it was that Chriſt was made for us, and what he underwent for our ſakes. He took upon him our ſins in the guilt of them; expoſed himſelf to the dreadful threats of a ſevere, but moſt righteous Law; and whereas ſin inevitably muſt be puniſhed, he ſubmitted himſelf to that alſo, and in love to us ſaved us from ours, by his own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein he ſatisfied Divine Juſtice, and averted that Curſe which inevitably would have fallen on us from the wrath of God provoked againſt us by our ſins; by this 'tis clear, Into this capacity he put himſelf, the Law found him, and under this capacity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs went out againſt him, and he died for us to redeem us from the Curſe, and to inveſt us with the Bleſſing. I paſs now to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To the confirmation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44263:121"/>and proof of this,
<note place="margin">2d. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> That Chriſt did die thus for us; a curſe was both threatned and executed upon him, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. ult. He made him who knew no ſin to be ſin for us.</hi> There is an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy in the words (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>He made him ſin;</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay, he made him a ſinner, but he made him ſin, that it might the more evidently appear how he did bear what was threatned againſt ſin, the Curſe coming on us as an effect or conſequent of ſin; He who was made ſin for us, expoſeth himſelf to that ſad effect, and taketh on him the Curſe due to us; and being found ſo charged, muſt die to remove the Curſe from us. This Text of the Apoſtle in effect then ſaith. That Chriſt had our ſins imputed to him, bore the Curſe of them, and that for our good, <hi>viz. That we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him;</hi> That we might be accounted and treated as righteous ones, which in effect is the ſame with what we have already ſaid, That Chriſt was made a Curſe, and ſo died for us, that we might with righteous ones live, and poſſeſs the bleſſing. It is not to be doubted, that Chriſt made ſin for us, was thereby made a Curſe for us, and therefore died, bearing that effect of our ſin; vindicating the honour of the Law which we had tranſgreſſed, and ſatisfying the Law-giver whom we had provoked. In a word, Chriſt made ſin for us, underwent the Curſe our ſin deſerved, and the Law threatned, that in our ſtead he might ſatisfie Juſtice; and that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might give the bleſſing which we needed, and the Goſpel promiſeth; or in the Apoſtle's own words, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44263:122"/>might come on us Gentiles. Again, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. tells us, <hi>God ſent his Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</hi> In which words you read expreſly, that God ſent his Son, and that he ſent him in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, not by inherent vice, but like it, through imputed guilt, and obnoxiouſneſs to the Curſe, both which lay on all fleſh that had ſinned, and both which was laid on him, who thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; in which capacity he appear'd not only to the world (which judged him whom they knew not) nor only to his enemies (who did maliciouſly ſlander him they hated) but he preſented himſelf to God in our ſtead, bearing our Sin and Curſe; for removal of both which he was made a Sacrifice, an Expiatory Sacrifice, which the Text expreſſeth conciſely (by <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>) and our Interpreters in the Margin have rightly explained, A Sacrifice for ſin; this being the proper import of the phraſe, as is evident to all who are able and willing to compare the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

In one word, he that was ſent to be a ſacrifice for ſin, muſt

Phil.</hi> 3.7. <hi>He took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> and in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity did humble himſelf unto death, even the death of the Croſs, ſaith the Apoſtle; which paſſage poſſibly is not enforced to ſpeak other than its own proper ſenſe, if it be thus explained: <hi>He took upon him the form of a ſervant, i. e.</hi> put himſelf into the ſtate and condition of an accurſed perſon, and ſo died for them he loved and repreſented. The Scripture doth ſometimes uſe this manner of ſpeech to expreſs a Curſe on a man, or on

                     </gap>, the form of a ſervant in which Chriſt appear'd, beſpeaks his appearance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Curſe for us. And in this conjecture on this place I am confirm'd by the authority of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> on this place.
<note place="margin">Jam quod accepit formam ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi non proprin referri videtur ad buinanam naturam aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptam, ſed ad ſpeciem &amp; ſimilitudinem hominis nocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, enjus perſonam pro nobis geſſit dum ſlagellatur, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, crucifigitur.</note>

                  <p>Chriſt in our ſtead appear'd under a Curſe, and ſo died an accurſed death, that by this means we might live in hope of a bleſſed life; and as the Text hath it, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come on us Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and that we might receive the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> both of Sanctification to enliven us to our duty, and of Adoption, to enſure us of an hoped reward; and ſo be delivered from ſervitude and miſery of ſin in which lyeth a Curſe indeed.</p>

                  <p>Now this duly conſidered will promote the increaſe of our graces. The Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant who can meditate on Chriſt dying a Curſe for us, may thereby excite his graces, and exerciſe them to an improvement of them; ſuch meditations will be as leſſer ſtreams to a River which they greaten whilſt they run in the ſame chanel.</p>
                  <p>A brief ſpecimen of this will ſatisfie, I hope, and ſet the ſoul on work, wherein for his help I ſhall ſhew him an Eſſay in a rude draught of this, in eight following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Graces, which well become a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility and Self-abaſement is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionably a Sacramental grace;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</note> a grace we ſhould Bring to, exerciſe at, and improve by the Sacrament of our Lord dying for us. And the conſideration of his death repreſented under the circumſtances of a Curſe, is a very ſuitable, and a likely means to effect this: For it doth repreſent to our thoughts not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſufferings of our deareſt Lord and friend, but convinceth us that it was our ſin which procur'd this to him; and that we muſt have been miſerable for ever if he had not thus died. Thus our ſin and miſery is ſet before us, and theſe will humble a ſoul; theſe will bow the generous courage and ſtoutneſs of the nobleſt and higheſt mind. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery alone cannot break the courage of a virtuous and innocent mind, Nil conſcire ſibi,</hi> &amp;c. A ſoul clear and approv'd to its ſelf, is an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable fortreſs: And <hi>the ſpirit of a man will bear theſe infirmities.</hi> Indeed <hi>a baſe</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous <hi>mind breaks</hi> into ſhivers <hi>under a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44263:124"/>load of croſſes.</hi> But the ſoul under ſorrows, or in danger of deſerv'd miſery, reflecting on its own guilt, and looking through the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, on the greatneſs of its ſorrows, is the more humble, becauſe more refined and excellent in it's temper, principles and aims. <hi>True lowlineſs of ſpirit,</hi> or humility that is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine, <hi>may</hi> poſſibly <hi>firſt guſh out in a tear from pain;</hi> But <hi>it's conſtant running</hi> is in tears <hi>for ſin. Miſery may broach the veſſel,</hi> but it is <hi>ſin</hi> that <hi>keeps it running. Miſery may make the beſt deſpiſed in others eyes; ſin makes him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in his own.</hi> Men will tread on a diſtreſſed fortune, but the <hi>humble ſoul will tread on its ſinful ſelf.</hi> And now ſerious <hi>Reader,</hi> caſt thine eye upon Chriſt made a Curſe, and (ſuppoſe) for thy ſelf, and then tell me, what is firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on? is not thy miſery the title page of that great Volume of ſorrows, which Chriſt did bear for thee, when he was made a Curſe, and underwent it in thy ſtead? waſt not thou in danger of that Curſe? didſt thou not dwell on the borders of an eternal, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite miſery? and waſt thou not every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in danger to be haled, and thruſt head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into a priſon of wofulleſt darkneſs, and unſpeakable ſorrows? Did not the Curſe laid on Chriſt hang over thy head? It was thy ſin, thy miſery, that Chriſt lay under; and this will humble thee if thou haſt any ſpark of ſpititual ingenuity; if there dwell any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous diſpoſitions within thy breaſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>what is it to be curſed,</hi> but <hi>to lye under the tranſgreſſion of a righteous Law? and what will abaſe an ingenuous ſpirit, if the baſeneſs of ſin will not?</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44263:125"/>And how is he abaſhed and aſhamed that any reaſon is pretended for unreaſonable railing? Now much more abaſhed is the ingenuous ſpirit when a ſober man, when a judicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of his own words, as well as of other mens carriages ſhall condemn and adjudge him worthy of a Curſe. But here it is the Lord, who adjudged thee to a Curſe, and canſt thou remember this, and not be humble, and not reflect upon thy ſin which provoked ſo juſt a Wiſdom and ſuch deliberate Juſtice to execrate thee? <hi>David</hi> was humble when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed, becauſe <hi>it might be God had ſaid to him, Curſe David.</hi> When thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveſt the Sacrament, thou remembreſt Chriſt, whom God made a Curſe for thee; there God tells thee, Thou hadſt been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever curſed, if Chriſt had non been once curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There thou mayeſt ſee a holy, wiſe, juſt and infinitely excellent perſon diſpleaſed with thee, and provoked againſt thee; and ſurely ſuch a ſight will (I am certain it ſhould) make thee abhor thy ſelf and be humble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Farther, thou hadſt a fair and open tryal of thy Cauſe, and it now ſtands in the greateſt Court of Record in the world: It is there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred that thou art the ſon or daughter of a tainted blood,</hi> a child of an accurſed ſtock. In the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> God tryed and caſt thee, and told thee what thou muſt expect; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> he ſhewed thee this Record ſtood firm, the ſentence unrepealed; and if the blood of Chriſt dying, and bearing the Curſe for thee, had not waſht out the ſtain, thou hadſt remained ſtill under a curſe and ſtain. It is accounted a glory in an Antient
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44263:126"/>Family, that the blood is not ſtained with any treaſonable practices againſt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riagn; and it is a diſparagement and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of their glory and greatneſs, that the blood is embaſed by diſloyal deſigns and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. When thou receiveſt the Sacrament, and ſeeſt Chriſt dying an accurſed death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, Thou art minded of thy ſtained blood, and of the recorded atteindure that God brought in againſt thee.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>And thou mayeſt do well to remember what proof and evidences were againſt thee too, ere God adjudged thee to this Curſe which thy Saviour underwent for thee; the notoriouſneſs of the fact; the ſelf-ſilencing conviction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; thy Father againſt thy Mother;</hi> Adam <hi>againſt</hi> Eve; <hi>thy own family evidence againſt thee in this matter.</hi> Thou canſt find no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an exception to the witneſs.

Whoever thou art who rightly perceiveſt the myſtery of this Ordinance, and doſt rightly receive it, thou art evidence for God againſt thy ſelf, and confeſſeſt the matter, that thou deſervedſt to die for thy ſins in that very capacity and notion that Chriſt died for them. If he died an execrated, curſed death for thee, The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a memorial of thankfulneſs to God, and to Chriſt for ſparing thee, and letting thee eſcape, whileſt the bleſſed Son of God died in thy room.

I may think you either know not how excellent the proviſion is, or you like it not, or you are full of ſomewhat elſe, or you doubt your welcome, if you ſit as if you came to feed your eye, but not to ſatisfie your ſouls. If the Sacrament of the body and blood of Chriſt be the Supper of the Lord; if it be a feaſt; if it be ſtored with choiceſt variety of ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rarities; if it be the Goſpel Mannah, why are your longing deſires ſo weak, ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſo uneaſily taken off?

The beſt wine is drawn out for this feaſt, and it's pity it ſhould not have a thirſty ſoul, whoſe thirſt can reliſh its worth. He knows nothing of this Ordinance, who knows not it is a ſpiritual feaſt, to be attended with a ſpiritual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and therefore I proceed to give you a ſpecimen of that which is in this Dying of our Lord, to whet the appetite of the ſoul; and ſo let the firſt Conſideration for example be this; firſt, <hi>In this kind of Death the ſoul ſees both that which will awaken and add vigour to its averſation of ſin or evil, and what will awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſtrengthen its inclination and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion after deliverance from that evil.</hi> In the Curſe thou ſeeſt what an evil ſin is, and thou muſt bear it, or deſire Chriſt that he would; if thou deſireſt not that he may really bear the Curſe for thee, as in the Lord's Supper he Sacramentally doth, it will be interpreted that thou deſireſt all that evil ſhould light on thee which thy ſin deſerveth; and <hi>canſt thou deſire to be curſed? canſt thou deſire to de damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? canſt thou ſee miſery like a black ſtorm hang over thy head, and not fly to ſhelter?</hi> See then in a Sacrament Chriſt tendered to bear thy Curſe, thy miſery, and <hi>ask thy ſelf, whether it be not deſirable? ask thy ſelf, ſhall I deſire this or no? ſhall I wiſh, and intreat, and be willing to be freed from ſo great evil or no?</hi> In the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the Lord tells the diſcerning ſoul, Here, take my Son, and if thou deſireſt it, he ſhall bear thy deſerved Curſe, and thou ſhalt inherit an undeſerved bleſſing; go think on it, and tell me what thou wilt do, whether

Now God propoſes in Chriſt thus dying, A ſure way of obtaining his bleſſing, which is infinitely better than the bleſſing of any man; and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Son's body propoſeth a ſure means for our eſcaping from his Curſe, which is infinitely more to be feared than the curſes of all men. <hi>God can load thee with one Curſe more than all the men in the world can do with all theirs.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>In Chriſt's Death conſidered as a Curſe, there is yet farther ſomewhat to engage the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> of the ſoul unto Chriſt, and to draw forth it's willingneſs unto an embracing of Chriſt: <hi>And that is the infallibility and certainty of our deliverance from this Curſe upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt;</hi> thou mayeſt be ſure to eſcape, for thou mayeſt be ſure Chriſt will not loſe his life; if he die, he will accompliſh his own ends, and thy hopes, and the hopes of every believing ſoul, by his death; <hi>He hath indeed laid down his life, but he hath not loſt it.</hi> He will not leave thee under uncertain and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likelihoods, if he makes himſelf liable to thy puniſhment; he will be ſure that thy ſoul ſhall eſcape it; <hi>And if he bear thy Curſe, he will be enſured thou ſhalt not bear it.</hi> Now having ſuch a good, as this deliverance, and ſuch an evil as the Curſe, in thy eye; and ſuch a ſure and infallible means of eſcaping the one, and obtaining the other, <hi>Canſt thou,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:44263:129"/>oh conſiderate! oh diſcerning ſoul! <hi>do leſs than deſire this Chriſt, this ſhare and intereſs in his death?</hi> If thou hadſt no more than faint probabilities that it might be ſo well with thee, thou wouldſt in other caſes ſtrongly deſire to try: oh why not in this! why not here! other probabilities can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, perſwade, prevail and carry thee through tedious Journies, and coſtly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thou juſtifieſt thy hopes and thy deſires with the likelihood of ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>And what is the reaſon? whence is it that ſo great certainty can do ſo little with thee in this? oh the deplorable ſtupidity of man! the ſenſleſs backwardneſs of his heart! oh think, I ſay, think on it, Jeſus Chriſt was made, and died a Curſe for thee, and it is certain thou mayeſt eſcape by him; awaken thy deſires, and look after him.

If thou yet wilt not deſire Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that hath been ſaid already, yet at leaſt conſider with thy ſelf, and bethink thy ſelf, What doſt thou here if thou deſire not Chriſt? <hi>Why art thou among them that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend they needed, who do in the Sacrament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate, and ſeek to find Chriſt dying and bearing the Curſe for them?</hi> If thou need him not, why doſt thou pretend to ſeek him? if thou ſeek him, why doſt thou not really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to find and meet him?

                  <p>And I will tell thee, take it as thou wilt, <hi>Thou that art not willing to find a bleſſing in Chriſt whom thou ſhouldſt deſire to meet in the Sacrament, ſhalt find a curſe which thou wouldſt not.

                     </note> might be more deeply root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our hearts. The Learned Profeſſors at <hi>Saumur</hi> tell us, <hi>Many things lead us to this perſwaſion, that Chriſt chiefly eyed the increaſe and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith, as the end when he appointed this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to his Church to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated.</hi> A true and lively Faith fits for receiving this Supper of the Lord; and an increaſing confirmed Faith ſhews that this Ordinance is fitly received. <hi>We muſt not come to it without true Faith, and we muſt not go from it without an increaſe to our Faith.</hi> We muſt lay hold on Chriſt that we may come; and we muſt come that we may lay faſter hold on Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now the conſideration of Chriſt dying as a Curſe for us, will notably confirm us in our reſolutions to adhere and cleave faſt to Chriſt. For now</p>
                  <p>The conſiderate, ſerious, meditating Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, may hence reflect upon the choice which he hath made, the gift he hath receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the condition he is now in by believing, and ſo approve the choice, keep faſt the gift, ſettle himſelf in that condition, and farther
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44263:130"/>ſecure that ſtate to himſelf by ſtrong reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Faith, and adhering to Chriſt, who by this death delivers us from that curſed death we deſerved; and ſo you may ſuppoſe the ſoul to argue with it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I do this day commemorate the death of my Lord, which died under a Curſe for me; <hi>and if I do not now believe, or if I ever ſhould by unbelief caſt off my Lord, I muſt bear my own deſerved Curſe:</hi> I have then good grounds, I have beſt reaſon to warrant my firſt believing and going to Chriſt: I have as good reaſon to continue my purpoſes, and confirm my reſolution of believing ſtill. <hi>It is not poſſible I ſhould have any reaſon to repent my firſt choice of Chriſt, my firſt fiducial adhering to Chriſt by that I was delivered from a Curſe;</hi> and this deliverance is freſhly remembred in the Sacrament, and the reaſonable, well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and prudent choice of my ſoul is preſented to me; and now my ſoul, thou mayeſt ſay, this was the wiſeſt, moſt juſtifiable and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional compact thou ever didſt make. And I aſſure thee, <hi>until thou ſee a reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt be in love with, and dote upon a Curſe, thou canſt not be out of love with, or weary of thy adhering to Chriſt.</hi> The more thou ſeeſt the wiſdom and prudence of this Act, the more thou wilt like it, and the more reſolute and conſtant thou wilt be in it; and now the oftener thou conſidereſt at the Sacrament the lively pourtraiture of thy deliverance from a Curſe by Chriſt received and adhered to by Faith; the oftener wilt thou renew thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and reſolutions to adhere to him, the oftener wilt thou look, and take heed of that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44263:131"/>which may weaken thy adherence, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thee from Chriſt; and ſuch renewed carefulneſs and heed will much improve thy Faith; <hi>Renewed purpoſes to believe, are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrength in believing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, The conſidering ſoul will ſee in this review of Chriſt dying a Curſe, <hi>The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, profit and gain of Faith chuſing and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto Chriſt.</hi> It will ſee it ſelf repaired and made whole after the greateſt and ſoreſt dammage; ſin which brought the Curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoul, did the ſoul greateſt injury and dammage, it made a ſhipwrack of all its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and treaſure. Sinful and accurſed man is the pooreſt, forlorn and undone wretch in the world, a very bankrupt. But now application unto Chriſt with a purpoſe to adhere unto him, and chuſe him for ever; this ſets the man free from the Curſe; it ſets him up again; it puts a new ſtock into his hand; it enricheth him with the fulneſs of a Bleſſing. For <hi>if Chriſt bear thy Curſe, thou ſhalt wear his Crown;</hi> if he take upon him thy guilt, and ſin and wretchedneſs, he will take thy believing ſoul into his bleſſedneſs; <hi>if he ſuffer thy deſerved puniſhment, thou ſhalt inherit his glorious purchaſe;</hi> and what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable profit is this? how good and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching a bargain is this? and all this doth the believing ſoul receive and gain by Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Curſe to redeem it from the Curſe, and to purchaſe the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> for it; and all this becomes the believing ſouls gain; God gives this to every one who chuſeth his Son. <hi>By his Poverty we are made Rich, and by his Curſe we gain the Bleſſing.</hi> Now at
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44263:131"/>every Sacrament this Bargain is confirmed and ratified, and the ſoul ſees the gain of it; and until it can rationally deſire to loſe ſuch a bargain, it cannot but ſtrongly deſire to keep to its contract: Every remembrance of our riches by Jeſus Chriſt, is, or ought to be a confirmation of our choice of him. <hi>Renewed views of our gain, will be renewed purpoſes to hold faſt our bargain;</hi> and thus may the ſoul grow ſtrong in its adhering and cleaving faſt to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The conſidering ſoul doth view its <hi>own ſecurity, and ſweeteſt peace in the Death of Chriſt thus dying a Curſe for it.</hi> At the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of its Lord's Death in a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it calls to mind that peace which is made for it through the blood of the Croſs. <hi>The ſoul ſaith, if Chriſt hath born my Curſe, I ſhall not bear it.</hi> If I have choſen him, if I keep to this my choice, if I firſt believe and perſevere in believing, I ſhall ſtill have this peace in believing, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>I am delivered from the miſery of an accurſed ſtate.</hi> Before thou didſt believe, thou didſt or mighteſt have heard the ſad ecchos of a Curſe alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and frighting thee; if thou hadſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, choſen and believed in Chriſt dying, thou hadſt never heard one word of peace; and if after thy firſt choice, and faith, thou repent, relapſe and forgo Chriſt through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, thy danger, ſin and trouble will return upon thee; thy laſt ſtate will be thy worſt ſtate; think therefore what is beſt for thee, whether to go on to believe, or to go back through unbelief. Art thou ſurfeited with thy peace? art thou weary of thy reſt? is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44263:132"/>trouble under the miſery of a Curſe more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable than peace under the felicity of ſuch a bleſſing? I know <hi>the meditating ſoul which can diſcern this, will never think of deſerting its choice of Chriſt, until it can think of parting with peace for trouble, with joy for ſorrow, with bleſſedneſs for miſery.</hi> I know the more it perceives and finds its peace in believing, the more ſerious and reſolute will it be to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it may have and keep its peace. Renewed meditations on this Death of Chriſt will be renewed peace to a believer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed peace will be renewed purpoſes of believing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>The conſidering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul is able to diſcern this ignominious curſed Death of Chriſt to be the fountain of true honour and real excellency. The ſoul is delivered from a ſtate of baſeneſs and diſhonour by this Death of Chriſt.</hi> A curſed condition is baſe and diſhonourable, as well as miſerable and unhappy. The dregs of the people were by the Jews called the people that are curſed. <hi>Cam</hi> curſed by <hi>Noah</hi> is devoted to ſervitude to a baſe condition. And <hi>Eſau</hi>'s loſs of the Bleſſing was the bringing of ſervitude and baſeneſs on him. But now if Chriſt dying a Curſe were abaſed for me (may the believing ſoul ſay) I ſhall be exalted to honour, and <hi>my firſt act of believing was my firſt ſtep to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and my continuing to believe will be the continuing of me in my free, noble, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition.</hi> If I depart from Chriſt through unbelief, I ſhall go from honour to diſhonour, from excellency to baſeneſs, from the noble ſtate of a Son, to the ignobleſtate
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44263:132"/>of a ſervant, of a ſlave: And I know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate ſoul will not eaſily return to the baſeneſs and ignominy of ſuch a ſtate; No! no! Faith in my dying Lord did ſet me free from ſuch baſeneſs, and advanced me to the dignity I now enjoy; and my perſevering confirmed faith, will, and muſt preſerve and confirm me in that dignity: <hi>This prerogative my Dying Lord purchaſed for me whenever I would believe; this prerogative he gave me ſo ſoon as ever I did believe; and there is none can take it from me ſo long as I do believe; oh let me believe for ever, that I may have it for ever!</hi> I would never loſe this honour, I will never leave my Lord. Whilſt thou art able to make the beſt of this Death of thy Lord commemorated in the Sacrament, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thy faith, (which is done on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that thou mayeſt make the beſt of it,) thou canſt reſolve, or conclude nothing leſs than that thou wilt adhere now faſter than ever.</p>
                  <p>In this manner may the Humiliation, the Deſires, the Purpoſes of the Soul be wrought, drawn forth and confirmed upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Chriſt dying a Curſe for us: The ſight of our curſed ſtate will lay us low, and convince us; the ſight of a deliverance by Chriſt, will make us deſire that deliverance may be ours, and then knowledge of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ours upon firſt believing, and that it ſhall be ours ſo long as we believe, will perſwade us to look that our faith continue, leſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſhould reduce us into the miſery of a Curſe, whence we almoſt eſcaped. And let it be next obſerved,</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That Love to God and unto Chriſt,

Some men will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Apoſtle ſpake his very thoughts when he wiſhed that he himſelf were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Chriſt for his brethren, his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after the fleſh. Some judge it ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with reaſon, that they think the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle could not ſoberly, ſedately and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally deſire it, but that he did uſe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and freedom of an Orator, to commend his greateſt affection to his kindred by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſſion. But behold Reader, <hi>Paul's wiſh for his kindred, is Chriſt's own act for his; what</hi> Paul <hi>wiſht but could not do for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Chriſt hath undertook and undergone for his brethren.</hi> What ſome do think was too great for a rational and ſober deſire in the one; hath been found not too great for the choice and performance of the other. Now let Chriſt have but a ſerious view of this he hath done for thee, and anſwer thy ſelf this, or ſuch like queſtions; <hi>Is that too little to engage my love which was too great for any to undertake but Chriſt?</hi> Do I ſee Chriſt do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which few men will believe a man could wiſh he mght do, and do I ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my heart, my affection from Chriſt? Do I know that his love was ſtronger than death? he was content to be accurſed for the ſake, good, life and ſalvation of Believers; I ſee him for a while ſeparated from God, that he might bring me to God, and now he ſhall
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44263:136"/>have that love which is too great for any one, ſince he hath done what is ſo great for me.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place,
<note place="margin">5. Joy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental grace.</note> 
                     <hi>The Believer's Joy is, or at leaſt might be conſiderably improved in the commemoration of Chriſt dying as a Curſe for us.</hi> It is not to be queſtioned whether joy and rejoycing through faith in the Lord be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in our feaſting with the Lord. <hi>Joy is the ſouls reſt with delight in the Lord;</hi> and ſuch a diſpoſition of mind doth the Lord require and accept at this ſeaſt. Now let us obſerve how that his dying a Curſe for us, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our joy; and this may appear</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Nature of <hi>Joy,</hi> which <hi>is the triumph of the mind in its freedom and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from its fears; or in its attaining and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing of its hopes.</hi> It is <hi>a rational ſecurity of our beſt hopes, and a due removal of our worſt fears, ſinging a reſt and happineſs to the ſoul.</hi> Joy is the rapture of our ſoul, hearing and obſerving deſired events, ſweetly keeping tune with our deſires and hopes. It is the <hi>Tripudium Animae,</hi> the ſoul's dance to the Muſick which the God of Heaven makes for it. If there be any exſtaſies of joy, it can be from no other harmony than which is heard not from <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his melodious ſpheres, but from the Croſs of our Bleſſed Lord ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven and Earth in a bleſſed concent by his accurſed Death. The Philoſopher will tell us,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dilatatio cordis ob bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num praeſens.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>Joy is the dilatation of the ſoul, the enlarging of the heart to entertain a preſent deſired good.</hi> Good wiſhed for is the Sun, the heart is the Heliotrope, the flower of the Sun; Joy is the opening and turning of this flower towards the Sun. This, or ſomewhat
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44263:136"/>like this is Joy. Now in what can the ſoul triumph if not in its freedom from a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Curſe? What may poſſibly be imagined will ſecure the rational hopes and wiſhes of a Chriſtian better than Chriſt's bearing his ſin, its curſe and puniſhment, that Juſtice may not lay any ſentence of condemnation upon it, but abſolve and acquit, juſtifie and ſave it? Where can the ſoul better reſt, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late its happineſs in its reſt, than in a pacified propitious God? Tell me, who ere thou art, reading or hearing theſe lines, canſt thou deſire more than happineſs? Is any thing greater and better in thy wiſhes? Certainly either thou knoweſt not what thou anſwereſt, or elſe doſt anſwer it is thy greateſt, dailyeſt, hourly deſire; and that the man or woman who would aſſure thee of this, would fill thy heart with raptures of joy. Now behold theſe deſires anſwered in the Lord Jeſus dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remove that Curſe which kept thee from thy happineſs. If Joy be the enlarging of the heart to entertain a deſired good, lo here a good worth the entertaining, Chriſt bearing thy Curſe: lo here a good ſo great, that no heart but an enlarged heart can rightly entertain it: Oh be perſwaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and tell me then what affection it raiſeth in thy ſoul! <hi>Certainly he never feared, becauſe he never knew the danger of Hell, who doth not greatly rejoyce in his deliverance, and eſcape from it.</hi> Open but thy heart to receive, and thy Joy will as ſurely break out, as the ſtreams do when the ſprings and fountains are opened.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſt dying a Curſe for thee,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44263:137"/>will heighten thy Joy; <hi>For whatever thou canſt approve a ground of Joy in other mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing without this, thou mayeſt much more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove in thine own rejoycing in this without any other,</hi> There is very much Joy in the world which is unſeemly, and there is ſome which is juſtifiable, ſeemly and ſeaſonable; but whatever makes it ſo ſeemly, that and much more is in the Death of Chriſt dying an accurſed Death for us, to juſtifie and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Chriſtian's Joy. I dare ſtand to plead the <hi>Chriſtian's Joy,</hi> to <hi>excel</hi> on this account, <hi>as much as the Joy for recovery of a Crown and Kingdom doth excel the Joy of a wiſe man for the finding of a Pin.</hi> Could a Chriſtian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Joy to the exceeding greatneſs of his cauſe of Joy, it would incomparably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all other mens Joy, as much as the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very from a mortal wound excels the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſcratcht finger. Indeed all other Joy without this is the unſeemly Joy of fools or madmen; but this (without all other) is Joy of wiſe, conſiderate and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; and might we enter the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it would appear what trifles men of the world (how great ſoever, and how wiſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the account of the world) do rejoice in.</p>
                  <p>It is reported of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>French</hi> ſhore upon his delivery out of his Captivity,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Je ſuis le Roy.</hi>
                     </note> That he leapt and rejoyced with this, I am a King. And who that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues liberty, or ſafety, or power, or a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, cenſureth him for it, or doubts whether it were ſeemly? But oh believing ſoul! thou ſeeſt at a Sacrament a worſe priſon, a more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44263:137"/>doleful Captivity, crueller enemies, and more deadly dangers left behind thee, and thou ſet at liberty in a more bleſſed ſafety, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to a Crown and Kingdom, as much better as Heaven is better than <hi>France</hi> was; and this by Chriſt's Death as it was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Death, to free thee from the Curſe.</p>
                  <p>The men of the world rejoice in their full harveſts. The victorious Conqueror rejoiceth in the dividing of the ſpoils. The ambitious Courtier rejoiceth in his Court-preferment. But what Joy will the Barns and Stores of the wealthy man be, when he dies the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Death, and with <hi>Dives,</hi> is tormented in endleſs fires? Will the Joy of the preferred Courtier continue to him under the diſgrace which he ſhall fall into when God ſhall arreſt, impriſon, condemn and execute him as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed wretch? What will become of the Joys of Victories and Triumphs, when the Crowns ſhall wither before the hot diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God; and when the crowned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſhall be delivered up an accurſed wretched priſoner and captive in eternal chains?</p>
                  <p>In few words, there are many daggers lifted up, and ſtriking at the Joy of every man who rejoiceth in any thing but the Croſs of Chriſt, and firſt or laſt ſome one or other of theſe daggers will reach the heart, and let out the life of ſuch Joys. But the Believer's Joy in the Death of Chriſt dying a Curſe for him, is a Joy which is immortal, and cannot be deſtroyed: It is a Joy will moſt gloriouſly crown the Believer, when other mens Joys do moſt ſhamefully forſake, deceive and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44263:138"/>them. If then any may rejoice, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may much more; and this he may do at every remembrance of his Redeemer's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Curſe for him. And ſuch renewed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our cauſe of Joy, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly renew our Joy; he may rejoice ſtill more than yet he hath rejoiced, who ſeeth he hath more to rejoice in than all the jovial merry world ever ſhall have.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Renewed Meditations of Chriſt's dying ſuch a Death for us, will renew our Joy, appeareth from this, <hi>That our Joy will be moſt full, ſatisfactory and tranſporting to us when we come to the diſtincteſt, fulleſt and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt knowledge and apprehenſion of this Death of Chriſt.</hi> They who moſt fully apprehend, and who moſt particularly apply the Benefits of this Death to themſelves, who live upon it, and know what life it is, how excellent, how happy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe are fulleſt of pureſt Joy; and truly as we abate in our ability and skill to meditate on this Death of Chriſt, or as we abate in the exerciſe and actual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and thought of Chriſt's dying for us as a Curſe, the more our Joy will abate alſo. The Saints in glory do now rejoice, and will forever rejoice, for they do ever behold the ſcars which this Curſe hath left in Chriſt; they ever remember that Chriſt dying a Curſe, hath given them that bleſſed Life in which they ever ſhall rejoice. Now what it hath wrought on them, and what it will work one day upon us, proveth to us what it might work in us at the preſent: It hath now all in it which it ever will have, but we have not all in us which we ſhall have, when this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44263:138"/>dying of our Lord ſhall fill us with a never-dying, or abating love to him who did it, and with Joy in the thing done for us. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Believer rejoiceth more in the ſight of Chriſt dying a Curſe for him, as his diſtinct knowledge of it groweth, is not that his knowledge addeth any thing to it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his knowledge of it now maketh more of that Death, (which appeared not ſo much then to his own eye) ſo his Joy groweth with his knowledge. But now it is not ſo with other Joys, they leſſen as our knowledge of them increaſeth, and thoſe which at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we flattering our ſelves hoped would be pure, and deep, ſweet and laſting as a Cryſtal ſtream, prove to us when we come nearer, and live on them, muddy and ſhallow, ſcarce worth the taſting, and which is worſe, yet they prove bitterer than gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and of ſhorter continuance than a morning dew. But our Joy in bleſſed peace with God, in ſweet hopes of glory, in ſure foundations of faith, in endleſs happineſs to crown our faith, to ſatisfie our hopes, and to be the manner of enjoying our God, (which are the pleaſant fruits of Chriſt thus dying) do increaſe upon us as our inſight into them increaſeth, and are pureſt when neareſt; are deepeſt in the ſpring, or rather ocean of true Delight and Joy; are ſweeteſt when moſt lived upon; and are moſt laſting when we enter at laſt into them. <hi>The Joys of others are never ſo great as their hopes, nor ſo laſting as their deſires. But the Joy of a Believer in his Dying Lord, is at laſt greater than his hopes, and as long liv'd as his deſires.</hi> And in this he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44263:139"/>may exalt his Joy above the greateſt that ever the world boaſted of. If ever mortal man ſatiated and glutted himſelf with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joy, it was with a ſudden guſh, which left him ſo ſoon, that he had the more time to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment himſelf, and wofully wrack himſelf with the loſs of it. I believe <hi>Caeſar</hi> never met his expected content and joy in obtaining <hi>Rome</hi>'s Empire; I know it laſted not with him ſo long as he deſired; in one or both of theſe it proved leſs to him when he knew moſt of it. This made a good Emperour once ſay, That <hi>if men knew what thorns and cares a Crown was lined with, they would not take it up if they found it in the ſtreet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, oh bleſſed ſoul! whoſe Joy lives upon the Death of thy Lord, tell me, did ever any experienced, knowing, and expert Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian abaſe the worth of thoſe Joys with ſuch a report of them? Can thy own jealous fears ſuggeſt a rational, probable, likely ground of ſuſpicion, that theſe Joys are greater in hope than they will be in hand? doſt thou think that there is any diſappointment in Heaven? Are there any complaints that leſs is poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed than was looked for? Haſt thou ever had any cauſe to wiſh thou hadſt known leſs of Chriſt and his Death? or couldſt thou ever ſay that the Joy had been greater if thy knowledge and experience had been leſs? I know thou dareſt not ſay ſo, nor debaſe the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus thy Lord. Turn therefore thy ſerious thoughts upon this, meditate more that thou mayeſt know more; for the more thou knoweſt of this, the more wilt thou rejoice in Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:44263:139"/>
                  <p>Thus renew thy Meditations on the Cauſe of thy Joys, and they will renew thy Joys. Others will ſee, and thou wilt find in thy own ſoul, that the more thy Cauſe of Joy abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the more thy Joy will abound. Now that Chriſt hath thus died, thy ſoul (oh happy Believer!) ſhall not be left in Hell, nor ſhalt thou ſee an eternal corruption: This is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to thee by the Lord, whoſe Death thou commemorateſt. Say then and ſpeak it with enlarged heart, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoiceth; moreover my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope, for God will not leave my ſoul in hell.</hi> And now, oh my ſoul! ſet thy ſelf to hear what may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thee. By theſe who will have to do with thee in thy moſt weighty matters. And ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt what would a judicious and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Believer ſay? What news would ſuch a one tell thee from Mount</hi> Calvary? <hi>from the Croſs of Chriſt?</hi> Suppoſe thou heardeſt ſuch an one improving this Doctrine, why ſhould I fear when the iniquity of my heels compaſſeth me about? hath not my Lord taken away all the Curſe I feared? Do I not ſee him evidently ſet forth crucified before mine eyes? he drank off the bitter cup of aſtoniſhment, I will therefore take the cup of ſalvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in him; yea and I will tell my Brethren the good news, that they may rejoice with me. Come all ye that fear the Lord, hear and rejoice, for <hi>I have found at the Croſs of Chriſt, the bleſſing which I loſt in Paradiſe, and which is more, I found yours there too; and if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44263:140"/>you will go with me quickly, you ſhall find it too.</hi> Come, oh come and ſee Chriſt laying down a Bleſſing for thee, when he took up thy Curſe! would not ſuch a friend's voice ſounding in thine ear raviſh thy heart, or at leſt revive thy drooping ſpirits, and turn thy grief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to joy? Could'ſt thou do leſs than ſmile to ſee thy loſt Heaven found? thy dying Soul recovered to life? thy God reconciled and delighting in thee? Hear next</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>What language the Embaſſadour of thy Soveraign and Gracious Lord uſeth to thee, when he offereth a Dying Chriſt unto thee;</hi> a Chriſt bearing thy Curſe for thee. Behold thou drooping Believer, <hi>That Blood which I offer thee in this Cup, is the purchaſe of that happineſs which thou deſireſt; the atonement of that wrath thou feareſt.</hi> Lo here is that Blood which can abate the ſcorching heat of a ſelf-accuſing, condemning, and tormenting ſoul! Oh taſte, drink of it! this never failed of curing, eaſing, comforting <hi>ſo many Saints in Heaven.</hi> In one word, Chriſt's Miniſter doth in Chriſt's Name offer thee that Blood which was ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of many, and in which thou mayeſt find for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of thine alſo; and thou findeſt little if thou findeſt not Joy in the forgiveneſs of ſins. <hi>Thou art very ſlow of underſtanding, if a Publick Officer proclaiming thee acquitted and cleared, doth not raiſe thy joy.</hi> But yet, oh fainting ſoul! hearken</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>What will be the language of Chriſt himſelf to thee, when he unfolds thy bleſſedneſs, and declareth before Men and Angels that he took upon him thy ſin, thy guilt, thy puniſhment;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44263:140"/>was made a Curſe for thee, and ſo preſents thee to God, and makes good all thy claim to Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</hi> What heart is large enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the thouſandth par of that Joy! Oh! a ſingle ſight of this, one unrepeated, once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſentence of Chriſt's own mouth. Soul, thou art bleſſed, for I was made a Curſe for thee, would ſwallow up all other Joys, and would fill the heart of the believing ſoul with Joy unſpeakable.</p>
                  <p>Now I muſt tell thee, oh thou doubting, ſollicitous and trembling Believer! that Chriſt will ſo beſpeak thee ere long, and ſo give thee an entrance into thy Maſter's Joy, that thou mayeſt rejoice for ever in this Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I tell thee is the fruit of Chriſt's Death, as it was an accurſed Death. And if after all this thou wilt weep, and not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, I muſt alſo tell thee, thy tears are not wiped away, becauſe thou wilt not ſuffer us to do it, &amp; thou art a ſtranger to thy deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red joy, becauſe thou art ſo much a ſtranger to the Death of thy Lord. Oh that our eys were opened to ſee that fountain whence moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſtreams do flow continually! Lord give me a heart knowing, how to turn this kind of my Lord's Death into what Joy is hidden in it, and I know my heart will need no other, will deſire none but this.</p>
                  <p>Again in the ſixth place, <hi>A peaceable,
<note place="margin">6th. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental grace, peaceable diſpoſition to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, and tender affection toward our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our fellow Chriſtians, is a Sacramental Grace, a diſpoſition of mind which is never out of ſeaſon, and is moſt in ſeaſon at a Sacrament. Chriſtians ſhould ever live in charity, but they ſhould feaſt with their Lord, and with their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44263:141"/>Brethren in higheſt meaſures of charity.</hi> When they thus feaſt, they ſhould embrace each other; when they walk together, it ſhould be hand in hand. This Love-feaſt muſt not be allayed with any mixture of ſowre mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, bitter envyings, or unſavoury grudges of diſcontent. The Apoſtle doth give us a moſt excellent Rule for this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. <hi>Purge out the old leaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let us therefore keep the feaſt, not in the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice,</hi> &amp;c. In malice we ſhould ever be children, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at the Lord's Supper. I will not urge reaſons why we muſt be thus affected each to other, when we come to the Table of the Lord; for it is ſo univerſally known by all, and it is ſo neceſſary among many other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that too many think this alone ſufficient to prepare men for the Lord's Supper. It is true, who hath all other, but hath not this preparatory, is unfit; <hi>Whoſoever wants this alone is not fit, though this alone will not fit him for the Lord's Table.</hi> The want of this muſt keep him back from this Supper, until he hath a mind full of ſincere and true love to all men, eſpecially to all the invited gueſts of the Lord. Suppoſing therefore that it is nothing doubted, peaceable affections, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate tender love or charity to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is a Sacramental Quality. I ſhal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a little on the manner, how this may be improved and advanced by the Death of Chriſt dying an accurſed Death for us. And ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, When thou art at the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſeeſt a few of thy Chriſtian Brethren
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44263:141"/>there to celebrate the Death of thine and their Lord dying a Curſe; this in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood will be thy firſt reaſoning upon it. <hi>If Chriſt died a Curſe for us, then were we all under a Curſe; then were we all plunged in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; all were under the guilt of ſin, and under the wrath of God; and what tongue can tell what this is, or what heart can think of it, and not be compaſſionately tender over ſuch poor creatures!</hi> Can your obdured, hardened hearts, hear the groans of men tormented with the Strangury, or Gout, or Stone? Can you look upon the miſeries of an Hoſpital without yearning bowels? or can you look upon the tortures of one wracked and torn upon a wheel, or between wild horſes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a wiſh, oh that I might deliver them! what kind of hearts do you bear toward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, murthered and tormented Chriſtians, when you ſee the pictures of them, or read the hiſtory of them? do not your hearts drop into tender compaſſions toward them? Why now look on Chriſt dying a Curſe, he is the lively picture of thine and their woful ſtate, it is to be ſeen in his Death; read over the ſtory of Chriſt accurſed, it is the ſtory of thy moſt woful ſtate, and of the miſerable ſtate of them who are now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with thee; they were with thee ſinful, guilty, dying creatures, which ere long muſt have been groaning, ſighing, howling under the avenging wrath of the Almighty, if Chriſt had not thus died for thee and them. Look upon them, ſay (as indeed they were) behold what was ſaved of my ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack! Theſe were toſſed in the ſame veſſel,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44263:142"/>daſhed on the ſame rock, taken up helpleſs and lifeleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with me. Oh I never ſee them, but it comes into my thoughts, and my heart; my heart weeps over our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger: We do ſo often renew our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate affections toward our companions in dangers, as the ſight of them renews the thoughts of our danger. That which in a different caſe <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>When I remember theſe things, I pour out my ſoul within me.</hi> The ſoul redeemed from the Curſe, will be able to ſay, when I remember theſe things, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and tenderneſs are poured out. The remembrance of a common danger,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nihil ad miſericordiam ſic inclinat atque proprii peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi cogitatio.</hi> Auguſt. <hi>Miſericordia eſt vicina mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeriae.</hi> Seneca de Clem.</note> is a moſt prevailing enducement to compaſſion. The Philoſopher could tell us, That <hi>this Pity is a neighbour to miſery.</hi> Whence likely it was that the Lord did enjoyn the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to ſhew a hearty compaſſion unto afflicted ſtrangers; for <hi>They know the heart of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for they were ſtrangers in</hi> Aegypt. We muſt compaſſionately and tenderly love, wiſh well, and affect thoſe whoſe hearts we know, for ſo much as we were in like caſe. Now this is one part of our brotherly love or charity; here it begins, though it doth not end here. This tenderneſs of heart is like the pith or tender pulp which runneth through the whole body of the tree. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Root on which the delightful Tree grows, and from which the beautiful fruits of love do bloſſome, bud, increaſe and ripen. <hi>And ſo often you water the root of Love as you do ſoften and mollify the temper of your heart,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44263:142"/>which is done when ſoakt in the thoughts of our common danger.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall cloſe this particular with that pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Queſtion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.33. <hi>Shouldeſt thou not have had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee?</hi> How ſhall we anſwer this Queſtion, if the conſideration of our common danger do not ſtir up in us a love of compaſſion to others? what bowels haſt thou if they do not now yearn and move towards them? We are apt to pity thoſe whoſe tormenting diſeaſes and ſharp pains we have felt; and if ever we felt the inward ſorrow and trouble of an accurſed ſtate, we ſhall pity ſuch who are under it, and with tender affection demean our ſelves towards thoſe who were under it; it will renew our ſympathy, and this will renew our love to them. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In the remembrance of Chriſt's dying a Curſe for us, there is the renewing of a moſt ſelf-abaſing and humbling conſideration.</hi> Now the renewal of this will be a very likely means to improve our love, which is a humble, ſelf abaſing grace. So that <hi>what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth our humility, will increaſe our charity. Solomon</hi> tells us, that <hi>onely by pride cometh contention;</hi> and our own experience proveth the proud man neither ſit to be choſen for a loving friend, nor to be truſted as one that will be conſtant in his friendſhip and love: ſuch an one will be ever breaking the laws of friendſhip, of which the Apoſtle diſcourſing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 5, 6. tells us, <hi>that it neither vaunteth it ſelf, nor is puffed up.</hi> Indeed he can ſee no cauſe of vaunting himſelf, who
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44263:143"/>views himſelf in this curſed condition repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and confirmed to us by Chriſt's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going it for us. Something or other there muſt be indeed, or muſt be thought to be, which ſhall exalt a man above his neighbour and brother. Now when it appeareth that it was equal guilt and miſery under which thou and I, and every one did lye, until Chriſt redeemed us, this cuts off all vaunts, and proud boaſting of our ſelves above others; and where pride is laid thus low, and taken out of the way, there meek and peaceable deportment outwardly, and meek and peaceable temper inwardly do ſpring up and flouriſh. This will prevent all increaſe and growth of malice, and diſlike for whatever thou canſt find in thy Brother to diſlike, the ſame, or as bad is found in thee; for before grace appeared to you, you were both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, both rebels againſt God, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law of God, both alike miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants and vile; nor may diſlike feſter and ranckle into malice againſt thy Brother: For if the Grace of God hath taken occaſion from his vile miſerable condition, to be and appear grace indeed to him, who art thou dareſt make it an occaſion of wrath or malice? I know the reaſonings of a believer toward believers are of another nature and tendency, they all ſavour of humility and peaceable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and forbidding all proud quarrels, and huſhing them with ſome ſuch reflection upon our ſelves, and our condition; ſuch was I but I obtained mercy. Alas! how are we miſtaken if we think we may boaſt our ſelves in the difference between us and others; for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44263:143"/>who made us to differ? There was much of reaſon in the penitent Thief, when he took up and reproved the railings, reproaches and blaſphemies of the other;
<note place="margin">Luk. 23.20.</note> 
                     <hi>Doeſt thou not fear God ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation?</hi> This ought to have humbled him, and kept him in a peaceable behaviour and mind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who were dying with him. Oh let us manifeſt a humbled ſoul, a mind abaſed and laid low with our guilt and vileneſs! let us manifeſt ſuch a mind by meek, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, loving diſpoſition towards our Brethren, who were firſt our Brethren in a Curſe, but now are our Brethren in Chriſt. Certainly nothing doth more become pardoned ſinners, than ſuch a peaceable behaviour and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nor do I know a more natural genuine fruit of our peace with God through Chriſt, than this our peaceable mind and behaviour towards men, when Angels ſhewed the glad tydings, <hi>viz.</hi> Salvation through Chriſt, they did alſo proclaim peace on earth; ſo muſt we when God makes us glad with this ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again thirdly, <hi>In the remembrance of Chriſt dying a Curſe for us, there is renewed the remembrance of forgiveneſs and pardon granted of God to us.</hi> The Believer commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating at the Lord's Table, doth there ſee himſelf pardoned, and the like pardon offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto others alſo through Chriſt dying a Curſe for them. <hi>Now this doth mightily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade with the Believer to lay aſide all occaſions and ground of quarrel, and ſo doth much more promote this brotherly love, increaſing it both in the habit of charity, diſpoſing the mind to it,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44263:144"/>and in the exerciſe and acts of it in our beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and converſe among Chriſtians.</hi> That which God hath done for us teacheth us what we are to do for others, when God might juſtly and righteouſly have curſed us, and refuſed us peace; he did for Chriſt's ſake free us from the Curſe, and entred, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtill keeps peace with us. Now ſaith the conſiderate Believer, I muſt be like my Heavenly Father, he hath accurſed but one thing for which he hath not yet, for which he never will have, thoughts of peace, and I muſt never make, or keep a peace with that accurſed thing, with ſin. But ſince it hath been the good pleaſure of my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make peace for ſuch who were cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and ſeeing he hath made them bleſſed by this peace, <hi>I muſt with better mind, though I cannot in better words, ſay with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> Num. 23.20. <hi>Behold I have received Commandment to bleſs, and he hath bleſſed, and I cannot reverſe it.</hi> When any grudge, envy or diſlike, would ſolicit thee to break the law of Brotherly Love, ask but this queſtion, <hi>Is God at peace with this man with whom I am ready to break?</hi> If God be his friend, and at peace with him, it is my beſt courſe, and moſt adviſed, to be at peace with him alſo, and keep and make him my friend. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the Life of <hi>Marius</hi> (that cruel man) that if he ſaluted not the man he met,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plutarch. in vit. C. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii.</hi>
                     </note> his ſouldiers took it for the token that ſuch a one muſt not live: But if he ſaluted any one, no hurt was done to him. At this preſent I tell you, <hi>no hurt muſt be done by you or me to ſuch whom the Great God ſaluteth as he did</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44263:144"/>Abraham, <hi>and as he doth ſtill ſalute</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham<hi>'s ſeed, calling them friends.</hi> As then the renewed uſe of the Lord's Supper is a renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed teſtimony of God reconciled unto us, and a renewed profeſſion of our friendſhip unto God; ſo it will be a renewing of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with thoſe who are ſo bleſſed and happy in their alliance unto the Lord, who is alſo our God. Moreover, ſuppoſe fleſh and blood could pretend an occaſion of contention and quarrel with thy Chriſtian Brethren, ſummon them to put in their Bill, and make their plea before Chriſt, who once died a Curſe for thee, and them; let the grievances be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated, and hearken what Chriſt would ſay to thee that contendeſt; He would ſurely tell thee that he did not ſtand upon greater injuries done to him, but did bear them, and forbear thee in them; witneſs thine own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at the Sacrament, where thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeſt to believe that Chriſt died an accurſed death for thee, and doſt thou dare to retain the thoughts, the remembrance, of farthing dammages done to thee, in that very place, and at that time where thou reneweſt the remembrance of many talent-dammages by thee done to God, all forgiven to thee by thy God, who thereupon requireth thee to forgive others? How ſilent and ſpeechleſs will the mercileſs unpeaceable man be when God ſhall make him read over ſuch places as theſe; <hi>Shouldeſt thou not have had compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant, even as I had pity on thee?</hi> And <hi>if ye from your heart forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father which is in Heaven forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> And
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44263:145"/>
                     <hi>he ſhall have judgment without mercy, who ſhowed no mercy.</hi> Come then thou froward, peeviſh, unpeaceable ſoul, look what Chriſt hath purchaſed and prepared for every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; he hath purchaſed a peace for them; he hath for them prepared a bleſſed peace through his bearing a Curſe for them; and he hath ſealed and confirmed this peace, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every thing that might break it; and this peace made thus, thou art now again confirming with God among thoſe which have equal ſhare and intereſs with thy ſelf in this peace; and wilt thou not judge it comely, convenient, neceſſary, (and what muſt be done by thee, <hi>viz.</hi>) to embrace them with hearty, peaceable affections, who are embraced by thy God, with as hearty affections as thou art, or canſt be? Oh come then! make peace with all thy Brethren, and <hi>forgive them as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven thee.</hi> And thus I have very briefly drawn out three particular inducements (among many other) which from Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Curſe for us, and all Believers ſhould perſwade us, and them to live in a Chriſtian brotherly peace, which becomes a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which ſhould be improved by each Sacrament. I now proceed to</p>
                  <p>A ſeventh Sacramental Grace,
<note place="margin">7th. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental grace, a Thankful heart.</note> which ought to be exerciſed at each Sacrament, and which may receive ſome addition from the conſideration of Chriſt's Death as a Curſe in our ſtead. Now this grace is a <hi>Thankfull acknowledgment of the great mercy we have by Chriſt's dying a Curſe for us.</hi> It doth exceeding well become us to be thankful, and praiſe the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44263:145"/>Lord for his mercy to us in Chriſt dying for us: And though praiſe be ever ſeaſonable, yet a Sacrament is the ſeaſon of ſeaſons for praiſe; then it is moſt in ſeaſon, though it be never out of ſeaſon. The commonneſs and univerſal praenotion of this truth among all Chriſtians, ſaveth me the labour of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. I need not prove that to any one which is denied by no one; let then praiſe and thanks attend our communion at the Lord's Supper. And among other motives unto praiſe, let us view ſome few ariſing from the Death of Chriſt, as it was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed death for us. And ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>To this kind of Death of thy Lord thou muſt be beholden for all the ſweetneſs which thou taſteſt in thy mercies.</hi> Thy ſin which brought thee under the Curſe, imbittered every thing to thee alſo; nay that ſin which curſed thee, forfeited all thy mercies; thou hadſt no right to them when once thou hadſt ſinned, and thou couldſt taſte no ſweetneſs in them if thou hadſt ſtill lain under the Curſe; thou hadſt no more right to thy eſtate, and life, than a condemned man hath to his; thou couldeſt have no more enjoyed them, than a penſive condemned perſon who is kept in priſon with a daily allowance to keep them alive unto the day of his near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing execution, every morſel is bitter to him, ſo would it have been to thee. Thou mayeſt read this in the emblem of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's ſtate; a naked man caſt out of a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful garden, and left in a place of thorns and briars: Such was the conſequence of thy ſin, caſt naked out of what thou hadſt, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44263:146"/>turned out among grieving thorns and briars. Now, would he not deſerve thanks who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth thee to a title? gives thee a new right unto all deſirable bleſſings? who ſhall root up thoſe curſed thorns, and plant the Vine and the Olive to yield thee fruit? Look then, this, and more than this done for thee by the Death of thy Lord made a Curſe for thee. Lo thy title renewed to neceſſary mercies, and mercies renewed unto their ſweetneſs and delightfulneſs; thou a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal received as a Son, and the husks thou didſt feed on turned into bread in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. Chriſt was accurſed for thee, that every bleſſing might be ſweetened to thee. Ever praiſed be our Phyſician who hath taken out the moſt of the poiſon, and hath turned the reſt into neceſſary and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Phyſick. God hath bleſt thee with every thing in Chriſt, that thou mighteſt bleſs and praiſe, that thou mighteſt be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for every thing, and aſcribe it all to the goodneſs of God in Chriſt. We owe all to this Death of Chriſt, and how little do we pay when we are thankful! Let us not then with-hold this little too. In one word, read over the latter part of <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. from <hi>v.</hi> 15. to the end of the chapter, and conſider how well he deſerves bleſſing and thanks from thee, who hath delivered thee from the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of ſo many Curſes, imbittering all thou enjoy'dſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The renewed thoughts of Chriſt bearing thy Curſe, will be renewed Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in <hi>renewed ſecurity and aſſurance againſt the fears and terrours of a ſelf-accuſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44263:146"/>heart.</hi> Thou ſhalt never bear that Curſe which the righteous Law threatned; thou needſt not fear it, if Chriſt died for thee; for he did die a Curſe for every one in whoſe ſtead he did die; and that God who accepted his Death, will never go from his word, or diſown the virtue of his Son's Death, nor caſt the Curſe upon thy ſoul. Oh thou trembling Believer! thy fears are the weakneſs of thy graces, or the want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing them; either thou knoweſt not what it is to have a Chriſt, a Jeſus dying a Curſe for thee, or elſe thou doſt not enough conſider it, nor obſerve how little ground of fear is left. Oh! <hi>It would be a bleſſed tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind to us to feel as little fear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſouls, as Chriſt hath left of Curſe behind him in the Law againſt us.</hi> Happy ſoul, who believeth that Chriſt died for him. He may look upon the Law, and find that there is not in it any Curſe againſt him; for Chriſt made a Curſe, died to redeem them who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. There is no doubt to be made of this Truth; there cannot be juſt cauſe of fear where Chriſt hath taken away the Curſe Which the Law threatned: Now there is no condemnation to ſuch, nor may any one lay any thing to the charge of theſe redeemed ones. And when this is duly weighed, how thankful will it make us! How much would a feeble ſwouning perſon thank you for a ſweet reviving cordial! what life would there be in his expreſſions of kindneſs for ſuch a courteſie! what loving embraces would ſuch a one court his friend with! eſpecially if his life had certainly miſcarried without this!
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44263:147"/>Oh unkindneſs! unthankfulneſs of us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! who lay in a ſwound of death, ſtrucken with the thunder-bolt of the Law, periſhing without recovery, hopeleſs without a Chriſt, accurſed for ever unleſs Chriſt become a Curſe for us; and we profeſs to know all this, and to believe it, and yet are ſtraitned in our thankfulneſs to him. The
<note n="a" place="margin">Plutarch. in vit. Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes.</note> Hiſtorian reports that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> gave one a thouſand
<note n="b" place="margin">The Darick was a coin bearing the image of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and the value of each piece was two ſhillings four pence; ſo the whole ſum amounted to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixteen pounds ſix ſhillings and eight pence, beſide the Cup of Gold.</note> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks in a Cup of Gold for a recompence of a little fair water offered him in the palms of the man's hand. But what have we given unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who hath brought us not a little water in his hands, but his heart and hands full of love, and blood ſhed for us! Oh come magnifie the Love of Chriſt, and be thankful to him for us! Remember the daies of thy fears, when thou wouldſt have welcomed the news of thy pardon, and received it on thy knees, with ten thouſand praiſes to thy God. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the anguiſh of thy ſoul, when the Arrows of the Almighty ſtuck faſt, and the poiſon thereof drunk up thy ſpirits, what pains wouldſt thou have taken then? what coſt wouldſt thou gladly have been at, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure thy ſoul's peace and eaſe? When thou thoughteſt Hell would be thy tormenting priſon for ever, and thou lookedſt on it as the greateſt evil, becauſe thou ſhouldſt bear thy ſins there for ever, and never have one ſmile from God, what thankfulneſs didſt thou
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44263:147"/>then think was meet for thee to pay, and for Chriſt to receive! Oh let not this be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten when thou comeſt to commemorate the Death of thy Lord; ſay then, and think ſo, Here is the blood of my loving, gracious Redeemer, who was content to be made a Curſe for me, that I might not ſlaviſhly fear my guilt, nor be in Hell
<note n="a" place="margin">So <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Spira</hi> thought &amp; ſpake of his fears and tears.</note> before I came to Hell; that I might not go mourning under the heavy burthen of my own eaſeleſs pains, which were worſe than death it ſelf; thoſe fears, terrours and pains which no tongue can deſcribe, my bleſſed Redeemer delivered me from them, and duly confirms it to me in minding me that he died, and that he died being made a Curſe for me; I muſt therefore mind my debt of thankfulneſs, I vowed, at leaſt promiſed and purpoſed never to forget, that more thankfulneſs was due to Chriſt then I could ever pay; Let my renewed view of this blood ſo affect me, oh my deareſt Lord! at every Sacrament, that it may ever renew my thankfulneſs, until thankfulneſs be ſo perfected, that I may never more need a Sacrament to put me in mind of this my duty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The renewed thoughts of Chriſt dying thus accurſed for us, will add to our thankfulneſs, <hi>In that the heart of a Believer meditating on this, may conclude, he is judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally acquitted from the charge laid in againſt him by the Law.</hi> This charge is ſin, deſerving death, to which charge every one muſt make his plea, and bring it to an iſſue; in which proceſs there will be no denying of the charge, it is ſo undeniably true, that <hi>all have
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44263:148"/>ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God,</hi> only the believing ſoul hath a gracious Redeemer who ſtept in between the paſſing of the righteous ſentence, and the execution of it, and offered Bail, body for body, life for life; took upon himſelf the Curſe, which was all the Law threatned, and died thus a Curſe for the Believer, ſo that now he may ſue for his diſcharge, and plead for his releaſe: Nay, he hath the diſcharge and releaſe offered to him as it were ſealed, ſigned and delivered to him at the Sacrament, whilſt God by his Miniſter doth put the New Covenant into his hand, and ſhews him that blood which was ſhed for confirmation of the Covenant, and for remiſſion of the ſins of as many as do believe. And that we may know how all this can be, how ſinners can be acquitted, and the Curſe threatned can be avoided, we are at every Sacrament minded of this, that Chriſt died for us, being made a Curſe for us; that is, undertaking and performing what he undertook on our behalf, he preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Juſtice of God, abode the Trial, was found in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, humbled himſelf to the death, even the death of the Croſs, and ſo ſuffered; all which is exemplified to us in the remembrance of his death, conſidered as the death of one who lay under a Curſe for us. It is not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Court Rolls in Heaven, but it is entred in the Regiſter-books of the Church by Chriſt's own order; and every believing ſoul at the Sacrament may ſee and read it, and conclude it for himſelf, and make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it to his comfort. Now what
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44263:148"/>heart can look on all this, and not look on this duty of thankfulneſs? what ſoul can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a pardon under the broad Seal of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not bow the knee, and kiſs the Seal! When an offender upon indictment and trial is acquitted, it is a cuſtom (and ſeemly enough) to teſtifie his thankfulneſs by praying for the King: How much more doth it become us to give thanks at the remembrance of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, abſolution, and being declared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted, as we are ſo often as we duly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take &amp; communicate in the blood which was ſhed for the remiſſion of the ſins of many. In a word, a bare promiſe of pardon deſerveth a grateful acknowledgment, but the paſſing of it under ſeal doth much more deſerve it: Had God paſſed his word onely, and required us to believe it, and praiſe him for it, we muſt have done it. Now he hath given us greateſt aſſurance, he hath proceeded judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially againſt Chriſt, the common and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate repreſentative, bail and undertaker for us; and hath appointed the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper as an Authentick and Publick Record or Teſtimony hereof; we ought the rather to be thankful. Renewed thoughts of this will renew our judicious and rational praiſe, if we have either judgments or reaſon exerciſed in things that excel.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, A fourth particular which will increaſe our thankfulneſs to Chriſt for our deliverance ſo often as we remember it at a Sacrament, under the notion of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by his dying a Curſe for us, is this, <hi>That it mindeth us we were delivered not ſimply from ſorrow, trouble and affliction, but we were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44263:149"/>ſaved from an accurſed ſorrow, from an accurſed trouble; we are freed from miſery, but that is not all, we are freed from an accurſed miſery;</hi> and this ſhould enhance our thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>There is an affliction that hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Comfort,
<note place="margin">Rev. 21.4. Jer. 31.9. Pſal. 126.5, 6.</note> tears that ſhall be wiped away, ſorrow and ſighing that ſhall flee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; there is a weeping which God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company and lead; this is a bleſſed weeping, for ſuch carry forth ſeed which is precious, and they ſhall teturn rejoycing.
<note place="margin">Matth. 5.4.</note> There are mourners whom Chriſt hath pronounced bleſſed; ſo that trouble and ſorrow are not ſuch evils when they are conſidered without the imbittering thoughts of a Curſe in them; it is the Curſe which maketh the Cup ſo full of aſtoniſhment. It is the Curſe which goeth with the condemned into Hell, that maketh it Hell indeed unto them. Affliction with the favour of God is a bleſſed ſtate; but affliction with the hatred and diſpleaſure of God, is a miſerable ſtate, and unſpeakably ſad, forlorn and woful. Now Chriſt dying a Curſe for us, hath ſaved us from ſorrows, and the Curſe, from miſery aggravated with the hatred of God toward the miſerable, ſo that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth much more thanks from us; it had been worth our thanks if we had been by him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from a bloody iſſue, or a deformed crookedneſs, or a burning fever, or a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom leproſy, or a ſad and ſolitary blindneſs: But more than this, more than all I can ſpeak did Chriſt deliver us from, when he did die a Curſe for us. Oh unparallel'd love of Chriſt! and oh the unparallel'd ingratitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians! Sirs, though you and I muſt leave the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44263:149"/>greateſt, the beſt part of this work of praiſe to another world, yet let us not leave it all; let us do ſomewhat whilſt we live, and are among men on earth. <hi>Heaven is full of thoſe praiſes, which, did we hear, would raviſh us: Let Earth be witneſs that we do not quite forget our Lord.</hi> Whereas you could have born all the envy, anger and malice of creatures, and it may be have contemned the weakneſs of it, you could never have ſtood under, nor have made head againſt the anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lord, nor have fortified your ſelves with reſolutions to leſſen the fury by leſſening your apprehenſions of it. The dear children of God in their bitter complaints, cry out, if an enemy, if any but God himſelf had done it, I could have born it. And the hopeleſs unbelievers cry out the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; let any thing come, let all come upon us, rather than the wrath of the Almighty; let rocks grind us to powder, or mountains bury us for ever under their weight: Oh <hi>the heavieſt of all theſe are lighter than one ſtroak of an angry avenging God!</hi> All theſe may be more eaſily endured than one Curſe of the Law: See then and conſider what thou oweſt, oh my ſoul! to Chriſt made a Curſe for thee! remember and be thankful; let thy heart, oh thou who feaſteſt with thy Lord! weigh firſt the burthenſomneſs of that Curſe which juſtice caſteth upon every ſin, and then weigh the exceeding great love of Chriſt who did take this Burthen, and bear it for thee; and I do nothing doubt, but as often as thou layeſt theſe in the ballance, thou wilt ſtill find thy praiſe, thy thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44263:150"/>too light; thou wilt be ſtill with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adding <hi>Glory and Power to him who loved thee,
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.5, 6.</note> and waſhed thee in his blood:</hi> And with the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, <hi>Thanks be to God who hath given us the Victory.</hi> Could you and I entertain theſe things within our breaſts, and renew our thoughts and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, we ſhould more clearly diſcern, that if there be ſweetneſs in our mercies, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite from our fears, or abſolution and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from our guilt, or deliverance from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed ſorrows, miſeries and death, we owe it all unto this kind of Death of our Lord; beſide all the poſitive bleſſings of grace and glory, of which I may not now ſpeak: if the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> on the Gentiles be worth our thanks, then our thanks is due to Chriſt dying thus; for he was made a Curſe for us, that we might be redeemed from under the Curſe of the Law, and that we might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to a bleſſed ſtate. In one word, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeeth his own bleſſedneſs procured by Chriſt dying a Curſe for him, cannot but ſee <hi>ſo much thanks as bleſſedneſs is worth due to Chriſt;</hi> and ſo the reviving of the memory of Chriſt's Death conſidered as a Curſe, will be the reviving of our thankfulneſs; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of thankfulneſs will be an increaſing and improving of thankfulneſs. So much to the ſeventh Sacramental Grace. The eighth and laſt I ſhall now mention, followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A diſpoſition and purpoſe of mind to walk in new Obedience towards God in all manner of converſation;
<note place="margin">8th. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental grace, New Obedience.</note> ſuch a mind muſt every welcome gueſt bring to the Lord's Table.</hi> No man may come thither who intends to go thence to his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44263:150"/>old courſe of ſinning. We muſt not, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts report of ſome venemous creatures, which lay down their poiſon when they go to drink, and having drunk, ſuck it up again; we muſt not ſo lay aſide our old ſins while we go to the Lord's Supper, as to renew our old acquaintance with them, nor tender our ſervice to them, ſo ſoon as we depart from the Table of the Lord, Men will not endure ſuch ſycophants and paraſites, who come to their table for a meals meat, and to fill their bellies, but then ſort themſelves for months together with the veryeſt enemies they have in the world: No more will God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him for a gueſt at his Table, who comes for a meal out of a cuſtomary formality, and then ſorts himſelf with thoſe ſins which God hateth, and commandeth ſhould be ſlain. This above many others aggravated <hi>Judas</hi>'s trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he came and ate with his Lord, when he had reſolved to betray him; this is to kiſs him with, All hail Maſter; when the kiſs is the very token by which his enemies ſhould know and apprehend him. The Lord Jeſus, who knoweth what is in man, and needeth not that any ſhould teſtify of man, will never let a man who lives and dieth of this temper, eſcape deſerved puniſhment. He knows they flattered him with their lips, but their hearts are far from him. <hi>Thou that comeſt to make a Covenant with thy God at a Sacrament, muſt come with a firm purpoſe to keep thy Covenant, for God will not be mocked.</hi> Better never come at all, than come with a mind hating to be reformed. <hi>God will ere long ask ſuch hateful hypocrites what they had
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44263:151"/>to do to declare this Statute of his, or that they ſhould take his Covenant into their mouths, Pſal.</hi> 50.16, &amp;c. It is confeſſed of all ſides, and would to God it were as well practiſed on all ſides, that every Sacrament ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to better lives, to holier converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that <hi>we ſhould ſin the ſeldomer, becauſe we have been ſo often at the Lord's Table.</hi> Now I ſay, that the remembrance of the Death of Chriſt dying for us a Curſe, hath in it good and ſtrong reaſons to move us to renew our obedience; and if theſe reaſons be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I do not doubt but they may prevail with ſome to renew their purpoſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of living leſs to ſin, becauſe Chriſt died a Curſe for us ſinners. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, In this manner of his dying (beſide the powerful influence of his Death conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the general, of which I ſpeak not now) I ſay, <hi>In his dying thus as a Curſe for us, we have a clear diſcovery of the vileneſs of ſin, how much it abaſeth and depreſſeth us.</hi> We look upon curſed things as the vileſt and baſeſt of things. A curſe and a reproach go together, <hi>Jer.</hi> 42.18. This was the thing which brought our Lord into ſo low eſtate, that he was deſpiſed of men; this made him of no reputation, becauſe of our ſin imputed to him, and the Curſe due to us for our ſin laid upon him; he became like a ſervant, and ſo died. Now then let a ſober judgment be made of this, and ſee how forcibly it diſſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from continuing in ſin. Do I renew the remembrance of my Lord dying as a Curſe? Could ſin which he never committed, which he never loved, which he hated infinitely,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44263:151"/>which was no otherwiſe his, than by impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; could this bring him to ſuch ſhame? What ſhame and confuſion of face will cover and overwhelm me, when after my ſerving my ſins, both the guilt imputed, and the baſeneſs, vileneſs and reproach of the fact committed, ſhall meet in one, and be charged upon me! Is it not high time to forſake this ſervice which will end in the ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of a Curſe? Doth the Sacrament mind me of the Death, the accurſed Death of Chriſt the Lord of Glory? I ſee then ſuch a worm, ſuch a lump of worthleſs fleſh as I am cannot expect any other event of ſin, than to lye down in ſhame for it; and if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (I do know this) I ſhould ſtill love ſin, and delight in it, how brutiſh and unreaſonable ſhould I appear to be, how unlike a man! <hi>I muſt either renounce my reaſon, or renounce my ſin.</hi> It is no dallying in a matter of this nature; I ſee the juſt and righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth would not ſpare his own Son, when he found him under my ſins, but laid upon him the puniſhment of them, the Croſs and the ſhame; and I deceive my ſelf if I think he will ſpare me, and not caſt the ſhame of my ſin upon me the ſinner; if I live and die in this ſervice, I ſhall riſe with thoſe who riſe unto everlaſting ſhame and contempt. <hi>I will therefore reſolve, and keep my reſolutions, of departing from ſin, becauſe I would not depart from my God with the ſhame and reproach of a Curſe for my ſin.</hi> Thus the renewed thoughts of Chriſt dying a Curſe for us, will renew the apprehenſions of that ſhame which attends the ſinner, and ſo renew
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44263:152"/>our purpoſes againſt ſin, as the only thing which can clothe us with ſhame, and we ſhall be as unwilling to live in ſin, as we are to bear the ſhame of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, In the renewed thoughts of our Lord's dying a Curſe, <hi>there lieth a motive to New Obedience, drawn from the congruity and ſuitableneſs of the thing it ſelf: Nothing more unſeemly than to continue in ſin after our profeſſing our ſelves to be his ſervants, friends and followers, who died for ſin.</hi> Nothing more juſtifiable than their leaving of ſin, whoſe Lord died for ſin; eſpecially ſeeing ſin brought upon him an accurſed Death. What wilt thou anſwer for thy ſelf in the day when this abſurd, unreaſonable and monſtrous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of thine ſhall be laid open before Men and Angels? when Chriſt ſhall ask thee whether thou hadſt not heard and ſeen that he was made a Curſe for thy ſins? whether thou hadſt not often been minded of this at the Sacrament? and when he ſhall farther demand of thee what thou couldeſt ſee in ſin, or hope to find in ſin, or expect from ſin, when as thy Lord could ſee, did find, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to find nothing elſe but a Curſe in it? waſt thou ſo ſottiſh to think of finding any thing in ſin better than what thy Lord found in it? or waſt thou ſo unthankful, that thou wert reſolved to offer deſpite to thy Lord, and ſerve that which brought an accurſed Death upon him? <hi>Whatever ſinners now judge, I know that a day will come when they ſhall judge nothing ſo unreaſonable and unſeemly as living in continued ſin, and profeſſing a crucified Jeſus.</hi> It is ſuch a ſelf-contradicting courſe,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44263:152"/>that none ever would continue it if ever they underſtood it: <hi>Nor is he, what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to be, who profeſſeth our crucified Jeſus to be his Lord, yet ſerveth his own curſed luſts:</hi> Chriſt doth not own him; he will declare to all the world that he knows not, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew ſuch workers of iniquity. But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it poſſibly might be (which yet never ſhall be) that ſuch a one reſolvedly continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſin, ſhould be owned by Chriſt at laſt, and received into a bleſſed ſtate of glory, what kind of anſwer could ſuch one make to his Lord when queſtioned? what was it not enough that I was once made a Curſe for thee? or did I not bear ſins enough for thee at firſt? or wouldſt thou indeed be crueller to me than <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers? or hadſt thou a deſign to wound my heart after I was gotten out of the reach of all others? after wicked men and Devils had done their worſt, and I had triumpht over them, and none but my friends could wound me, wouldſt thou be my friend that thou mighteſt do it more deeply? was this thy friendſhip to me? are not they the ſoreſt and cruelleſt enemies, who cover their hearty enmity with preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of friendſhip? either then be my cordial friend (ſaith Chriſt) and renounce thy ſins, ſerve them no more, or elſe come no more pretending to commemorate my friendſhip to the dying a Curſe for thee; nor ever let me be provoked with ſuch counterfeit alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and friendſhip. <hi>Chriſt cannot endure ſuch ſeeming to be what we are not,</hi> ſuch contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his Death. In truth <hi>it is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly to live in the curſed ſervice of ſin after
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44263:153"/>we are redeemed from the Curſe of ſin.</hi> And therefore the believing and conſiderate ſoul caſts off the thoughts of continuing in ſin, with a <hi>God forbid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> how ſhall I live any longer in ſin, ſince I am dead to it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>The renewed conſideration of Chriſt dying a Curſe for ſin, doth renew our thoughts of the odiouſneſs and hateful nature of ſin, which carryeth a Curſe into every place and perſon where it cometh.</hi> Chriſt's dying a Curſe for us, ſheweth us how hateful ſin is to the eyes of our God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reverâ eſt odium quo Deus pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, ab eâ perfectione quae Numinis naturam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet.</hi> Th. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. de trib. Foed. Div. th. 18.</note> who doth (and cannot but ſo do) loath, deteſt, threaten and curſe it where-ever he findeth it; of which truth the conſiderate believing ſoul hath ſo clear proof in the Curſe which Chriſt did bear for ſin; that he ſtands convinced beyond poſſible doubt of it, and cannot but conclude, that <hi>whoever reſolves to continue in ſin, muſt alſo reſolve to abide the hatred of God againſt ſin.</hi> He that will keep and maintain a communion with ſin, muſt expect that God will keep and maintain wrath and hatred againſt him; and this the Communicant is at every Sacrament minded of whilſt he ſeeth his Lord evidently ſet forth, crucified before his eyes, ſo that he is put to ſuch a kind of deliberation with himſelf: What! could not Chriſt take upon him my ſin, but he muſt alſo take upon him the burthen of divine diſpleaſure and hatred due to my ſin? what! is God ſo irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable an enemy unto ſin, that he would not, or could not, reſtrain his juſt wrath againſt the guilt where it lay, without the foulneſs of committing the fact? was the diſpleaſure of my God ſo hot againſt his bleſſed Son, who
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44263:153"/>was never tainted with any one ſin, only bare the guilt of many? I ſee then it is ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving flattery to hope for the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, whilſt I love my ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in it; if I will have his love, and eſcape his hatred, I muſt leave off ſin; for <hi>he hateth all the workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 5.6. <hi>He hateth the evil way,</hi> Prov. 8.3. I muſt either leave the evil way, or periſh in his hatred: For <hi>none ever eſcaped periſhing, who by continuing to ſin provoked his diſpleaſure and wrath againſt them.</hi> Reſolve therefore as becomes a man, (O my ſoul!) fly, and haſten thy flight from wrath to come; prevent the miſery of being hated and accurſed of thy God; caſt off thy ſin; <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and then God will ceaſe to be angry.</hi> There cannot be any thing in ſin to compenſate thee, to reward thee for the loſs of the favour of God. <hi>Sin can never heal the wounds which the hatred of God will make in thy ſoul.</hi> Poor creature! thou wert better have all the men on Earth, and all the finite inviſible powers of light and darkneſs to hate thee (thou mighteſt bear this) than have one God to hate thee; thou canſt never bear this. In fine, therefore ſaith the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, ſerious and conſiderate ſoul, I will not hazard, I will not run the venture and danger of divine diſpleaſure of the hatred of an Almighty God, for I ſee in the Curſe which my Lord lay under, what I muſt lie under for ever, if I will by continuing longer in ſin own my former ſins, pull the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them upon my ſelf, and love that which my God ſo perfectly hateth: I will every day labour to hate that with perfect
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44263:154"/>hatred which my God hateth; I will ſeek his love by a preſent ſeparation and divorce from ſin: I will this day renew my purpoſe and attempts to leave my curſed ſins, for God hath renewed my thoughts of his hatred againſt ſin by the renewed remembrance of Chriſt dying a Curſe for my ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the renewed thoughts of this kind of death, <hi>The Believer hath the renewed ſight and evidence of a death hanging over the head of every ſinner, which of all deaths is the moſt dreadful, which is fulleſt of horrours and ſoul-tormenting fears.</hi> Death is the King of terrours, though repreſented and cloathed in the leſt dreadful manner it can be.
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Ariſtotel.</note> No kind of death but is terrible enough, but of all, this is the moſt terrible, and only to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is this at the heels of the other that makes it dreadful. It is a moſt undoubted truth, that every one continuing to ſin, and ſo dying, ſhall die under a Curſe for his own ſin, though the ſinner ſhould live to an hundred; nay to many hundred years, yet if he live and die a ſervant to his ſin, he ſhall die accurſed; and this we may be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of by the accurſed Death of our Lord; for he died ſo, for as much as the ſins of God's Elect and choſen ones were laid to him; he was loaded with them, and all the guilt of them was charged on him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was he puniſhed, therefore he died in ſuch a manner. He was made a Curſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the guilt of our ſins was laid on him, and puniſhment due to that guilt inflicted on him. Nothing more certain, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> Iſa. 53.5. <hi>He bare the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44263:154"/>ſin of many,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>He his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. And all this evidently ſet forth before our eyes, ſo that the ſerious and conſidering ſoul ſoon comes to this concluſion, that whoever doth bear the guilt of ſin, he muſt die a Curſe for it, and he needs no other proof of it but this; Chriſt did bear guilt, and this brought him to a curſed Death. Now then he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to argue the caſe with himſelf; Can I continue in ſin, and not bear the guilt of ſin? Can I yield my ſelf a ſervant to ſin, and yet not be accounted a ſervant of ſin? Can I do the works of iniquity, and not be thought by judicious and wiſe men, a worker of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity? How much more will the juſt and righteous God occount me ſo? When I do any fact for which the Law of man will call me to account, can I do the fact and the Law not impute it to me? It is moſt ſottiſh folly to continue in the ſervice of ſin, and to flatter my ſelf that I ſhall not be accounted a ſervant of ſin, or to hope I ſhall not be loaded with the guilt of my ſin. And it is no leſs folly to think that we may lye under the guilt of ſin, and yet not ſink under the importable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of a Curſe. No, no, either I muſt leave my ſinning, or I muſt die that Death, which of all is the moſt terrible. I muſt be a Curſe under the wrath of God. Now therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve what thou and I ſhalt do; <hi>God propoſeth a Chriſt dying a Curſe for thee, to encourage thee to leave ſin, or to ſhew thee what thou muſt truſt to if thou live in ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He preacheth to thee this Doctrine, Life through Grace, if thou wilt obey, if thou wilt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44263:155"/>renounce thy evil way, for then thy Saviour ſhall be thy Peace, bear thy Guilt, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thy Curſe; or elſe Death if thou wilt ſtill refuſe to convert and leave thy ſin. And let me tell thee, it is Death with a Curſe; and conſider thou whether thou canſt endure it, and let me ask thee theſe few queſtions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Doſt thou not believe that there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in Death, when it is ſharpened with this ſharp and piercing ſting?</hi> Doſt thou not think that the Curſe doth add unto the dread and fear of Death? When God proclaimeth any one bleſſed in death, doſt thou not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thy ſelf that God taketh away much of the terrour of death? if ſo, then certainly when God addeth a Curſe with death, he addeth terrour to it; and thou muſt confeſs it alſo, if thou wilt conſider it. Now then ſay, Canſt thou contentedly think of dying for thy ſin? Canſt thou think of doing more than dying for thy ſins? <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil that time be come wherein thou canſt ſay, thou wouldeſt be willing to ſuffer more than death for ſin, thou ſhould'ſt not be willing to ſerve ſin any more in thy life.</hi> I know when we come to die, we ſhall judge ſin unworthy of ſuch a pledge of love or ſervice as one pang, or one fear, or one ſigh for its ſake; oh then we ſhall ſay, <hi>He loved ſin too much who for ſin's ſake added the leſt pang to death.</hi> Whatever thou doſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>leave to ſin, leſt tlou add the miſery of a Curſe to thy death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let me ask thee, <hi>Is there no manner of dying which is a terrour to thee more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary?</hi> If thou wert now to die, and mighteſt chuſe thy death, wouldſt thou chuſe any that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44263:155"/>were full of pains, or loathſomneſs, or both theſe continuing long? Are there not ſome kinds of death from which thou prayeſt to be delivered? and what kinds of death are theſe? are they not thoſe wherein God's hand would moſt immediately, and moſt publickly, and with moſt diſpleaſure appear againſt thee? wouldſt thou not account it worſe than death to be long dying with ſuch a torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lingring, and loathſom diſeaſe as <hi>Sylla</hi> the <hi>Roman?</hi> or as <hi>Maximinus</hi> the bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor? or as <hi>Herod</hi> the great? (whoſe ſtory is better known to thee) eaten up of worms? Would not others be ready to ſay of thee, That God had indeed ſet his hand againſt thee, that God judged thee unfit to live among common men, and unworthy ſo good a death as the death of common men? how would this trouble thee? This was the thing wherewith <hi>Job</hi>'s friends did moſt aggrieve him, that they would conclude God's hand againſt him as againſt an enemy. But now let me tell thee, <hi>The afflictions of</hi> Job, <hi>nor the woful death of a</hi> Sylla, <hi>or a</hi> Herod, <hi>have no ſuch evidences of God his diſpleaſure and wrath in them, as the eaſieſt death of an accurſed ſinner hath in it.</hi> For other deaths may, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are inflicted by other means; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the immediate hand of God alone, and can thy heart endure, or thy hands be ſtrong when God ſhall do this? is not his wrath as he is? He alone can bleſs, and he alone can curſe; and this ſhall be known to the ſinner in the day wherein God will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear againſt him; think then whether ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo well, that thou ſhouldſt not only die,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44263:156"/>but die a Curſe for it? whether there be any thing in ſin to fortifie thy ſpirit againſt the terrours of God's immediate furious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, and ſlaying of thee? <hi>Who dieth a Curſe, dieth under the revenging ſtrokes of an infinite God.</hi> Look then how much there is in infinite Power and Juſtice more than can be in finite; ſo much indeed is there in dying a Curſe for ſin, more than in naked, ſingle dying. For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, Let me ask thee one queſtion more, <hi>Doth not Death, a curſed Death reach the ſoul, and kill this? no other diſeaſe but is in the body, and is the diſeaſe of the body, and kills the body, and ſo vaniſheth: But who dieth a Curſe dieth in his ſoul, that is, his ſoul is ſeparated and disjoyned from that ſweet commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip with God which is the true life of ſouls and Angels.</hi> When God ſlayeth theſe wretches, and makes them ſacrifices to his offended Juſtice, he ſlays them with this, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed,</hi> Matth. 25.41.</p>
                  <p>Now, is it not more dreadful to die thus a Curſe, than barely to die? or if thou couldſt die, and be willing to loſe the life of thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for ſin ſake, canſt thou alſo be willing to loſe the life of thy ſoul for ſin's ſake? This is another arrow in this quiver, and which woundeth deeper than any other. The ſoul dieth when the man dieth a Curſe for ſin; and let me tell thee, albeit fooliſh and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate ſlaves of ſin will caſt away their ſouls for ſin, the wiſe and conſiderate Believer judgeth his ſoul, and the life of it, infinitely too good to be ſo ſpent and waſted. The death of the ſoul is ſo much more dreadful
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44263:156"/>than the death of the body, as the ſoul is more worth than the body; thou mayeſt not then continue in curſed ſins, for they will bring down upon thy ſoul a death of all moſt dreadful; ceaſe therefore to ſin, that thou be not a curſe for thy ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Let it be conſidered,</hi> after all this, (if this do not convince enough) <hi>whether thou couldſt be willing to die more than once for thy ſin?</hi> Would not a thouſand deaths one after another be too much to undergo for ſin? <hi>He that dieth a Curſe for his ſins, ſhall die more than ten thouſand times for them;</hi> he ſhall be ever, ever dying as many daies, nay hours, nay moments, as are in eternity; ſo many times ſhall the miſerable, deplorable, curſed ſinner die in the acute, freſh and renewed pangs of ſoul, every laſh of conſcience, every dolorous remembrance of what he ſuffereth for, ſhall be a death unto him. This makes it death indeed, and <hi>if thou canſt not love thy ſelf ſo little, as to chuſe to be ever dying, thou muſt not love thy ſins ſo much as to be ever ſerving them.</hi> Say then, if thou canſt not but fear endleſs dying, I muſt fear and fly endleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; who dieth a Curſe for his ſin, is as long dying, as his ſoul is living, and that is for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly, <hi>Can any thing ſweeten the thoughts, or allay the bitterneſs of ſuch a Death? Can there be any thing wherewith others may, or thou mayeſt bleſs thy ſelf after God ſhall have ſo curſed thee?</hi> Conſider what a loſs it is which is ſo great, that nothing can leſſen it; ſay then, though poſſibly thou couldſt endure ſomewhat for ſin's ſake, yet I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44263:157"/>can never endure a Curſe for it, which is more than to die; it is to die under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate avenging hand of God; it is to kill my ſoul; <hi>That is to be as often dying as are moments in eternity;</hi> and all this without any recompence and ſweetning allay, I cannot chuſe ſo to die; therefore ſaith the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Believer, the renewed thoughts of my Lord's dying a Curſe, renew my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the danger of ſinning any longer; this renews my diſlike of ſin, and I muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olve to leave it.</p>
